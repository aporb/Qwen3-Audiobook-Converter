The Light in the Window

Every night at exactly 9:17, a light turned on in the house across the river.

No one lived there.
At least, no one was supposed to.

The house had been empty for years—windows boarded once, then left to rot. The roof sagged. The garden was a mess of thorns and weeds. But the light was always the same: warm, steady, yellow. Never flickering. Never late.

Jonah noticed it the first night after his wife died.

He stood at the kitchen sink, staring into the dark, holding a mug he’d forgotten to drink from. When the light came on, it startled him enough that he almost dropped it.

He told himself it was nothing.
A reflection. A trick of grief. Someone passing by.

But the next night, at 9:17, it happened again.

And the night after that.

Weeks passed. Jonah began setting his clock by it. He would sit in the quiet, listening to the refrigerator hum, waiting. When the light appeared, his chest would loosen—just a little.

One night, he waved.

He felt stupid immediately, standing alone in his kitchen with his hand half-raised. But across the river, the light dimmed for a moment… then brightened again.

Jonah’s breath caught.

The next evening, he walked down to the riverbank. The air was cold. The water moved slow and black. The house loomed on the far side, closer than it ever had been.

At 9:17, the light turned on.

A silhouette crossed the window.

Human. Unmistakably human.

Jonah whispered his wife’s name before he could stop himself.

The figure paused.

Then, slowly, it raised an arm—just enough to be seen—and waved back.

The light never came on again after that night.

But Jonah slept better.
And when the evenings felt heavy, he’d sit by the window anyway, watching the dark—
certain that, somewhere, he wasn’t alone.
