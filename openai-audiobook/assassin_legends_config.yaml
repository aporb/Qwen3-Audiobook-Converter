  description: |
    For hundreds of years Westerners have been fascinated by stories of the Assassins,
    their mysterious leader and their remote mountain stronghold at Alamut in Northern Iran.
    Daftary traces the origins and early development of the legends - as well as investigating
    the historical context in which they were fabricated and transmitted.
