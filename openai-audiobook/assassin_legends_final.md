## Preface
*Pages 2-3*

Preface 
The Nizari Ismaeilis, an important Shi'i Muslim community, became 
famous in mediaeval Europe as the Assassins. This misnomer, rooted in 
a term of abuse derived from hashish, had been given wide currency by 
the Crusaders and their occidental chroniclers, who had first come into 
contact with the members of this enigmatic oriental sea in the Near 
East during the early decades of the twelfth century. Mediaeval 
Europeans, who remained ignorant of Muslim beliefs and practices, 
also transmitted a number of inter-connected tales about the secret 
practices of the Assassins and their leader, a mysterious Old Man of the 
Mountain. In time, these Assassin legends, which found their culmina- 
tion in Marco Polo's narrative, acquired an independent life; and the 
word 'assassin', with a forgotten etymology, entered European lan- 
guages as a common noun meaning 'murderer'. 
The Assassin legends transmitted by Europeans and the hostile 
accounts of mediaeval Muslim writers provided the primary sources on 
the basis of which the Nizaris were studied and evaluated by Silvestre 
de Sacy and other leading orientalists of the nineteenth century. This 
highly misinformed and distorted image of the Nizaris was essentially 
retained by the academic circles of the West until more recent times. 
But modern progress in Isma'ili studies, initiated by access to authentic 
Isma'ili sources, has at long last made it possible to distinguish myth 
from reality in the mediaeval history of the Nizari community. This 
book, drawing on the findings of modem scholarship in Isma'ili 
studies, aims to trace the origins and early development of the seminal 
Assassin legends, also investigating the historical context in which these 
legends were fabricated and transmitted. 
I am deeply indebted to Azizeh Azodi for her masterful English 
translation of Silvestre de Sacy's famous Memoir on the Assassins and 
the etymology of their name, which appears in the Appendix to this

## Introduction
*Pages 4-10*

Introduction 
Western readers of Edward FinGerald's introduction to his English 
rendition of Umar Khayyam's quatrains will be familiar with the 'Tale 
of the Three Schoolfellows'. In this, the Persian poet-astronomer Umar 
Khayyam is linked with the Saljuq vizier Nizam al-Mulk and Hasan 
Sabbah, the founder of the so-called 'Order of Assassins'. The three 
famous Persian protagonists of this tale were, allegedly, classmates in 
their youth under the same master in Nishapur. They made a vow that 
whichever of them first achieved success in life would help the other 
two in their careers. Nizam al-Mulk attained rank and power first, 
becoming the vizier to the Saljuq sultan, and he kept his vow, offering 
Khayyam a regular stipend and giving Hasan a high post in the Saljuq 
government. However, Hasan soon became a rival to Nizam al-Mulk, 
who eventually succeeded through trickery in disgracing Hasan before 
the sultan. Hasan vowed to take revenge. He left for Egypt, where he 
learned the secrets of the Isma'ili faith, and later returned to Persia to 
found a sect that terrorized the Saljuqs through its assassins. Nizam al- 
Mulk became the first victim of Hasan's assassins. This is one of the 
eastern legends connected with the Nizari Isma'ilis, known to 
mediaeval Europe as 'Assassins'. 
In the West, too, the Nizaris have been the subjects of several legends 
since the twelfth century. The first contact between the Europeans, or 
the Latin Franks, then engaged in the Crusading movement to liberate 
the Holy Land, and the members of this Shi'i Muslim community 
occurred in Syria during the earliest years of the twelfth century. At the 
time, the Nizari Isma'ilis had just founded, under the leadership of the 
redoubtable Hasan Sabbah, a special territorial state of their own, 
challenging the hegemony of the Saljuq Turks in the Muslim lands. 
Subsequently, the Nizari Isma'ilis of Syria became involved in a web of 
intricate alliances and rivalries with various Muslim rulers and with the 

Christian Franks, who were not interested in acquiring accurate 
information about their Isma'ili neighbours, or indeed about any other 
Muslim community, in the Latin Orient. None the less, the Crusaders 
and their occidental observers began to transmit a multitude of 
imaginative tales about the so-called 'Assassins', the devoted followers 
of a mysterious 'Vetus de Montanis' or 'Old Man of the Mountain'. 
These Assassin legends soon found wide currency in Europe, where the 
knowledge of all things Islamic verged on complete ignorance and the 
romantic and fascinating tales told by the returning Crusaders could 
achieve ready popularity. 
The Assassin legends, rooted in the general hostility of the Muslims 
towards the Isma'ilis and the Europeans' own fanciful impressions of 
the Orient, evolved persistently and systematically during the Middle 
Ages. In time, these legends were taken, even by serious western 
chroniclers, to represent accurate descriptions of the practices of an 
enigmatic eastern community. 
The Assassin legends thus acquired an independent currency, which 
persistently defied re-examination in later centuries when more reliable 
information on Islam and its internal divisions became available in 
Europe. However, progress in Islamic studies, and a remarkable 
modem breakthrough in the study of the history and doctrines of the 
Isma'ilis, have finally made it possible to dispel once and for all some 
of the seminal legends of the 'Assassins', which reached their height in 
the popular version attributed to Marco Polo, the famous thirteenth- 
century Venetian traveller. It is the primary object of this study to trace 
the origins of the most famous of the mediaeval legends surrounding 
the Nizari Isma'ilis, at the same time investigating the historical 
circumstances under which these legends acquired such widespread 
currency. 
The Nizari Isma'ilis, numbering several millions and accounting for 
the bulk of the Isma'ili population of the world, are now scattered over 
more than 25 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and North America. 
They currently acknowledge Prince Karim Aga Khan as their 49th 
imam or spiritual leader. The Isma'ilis represent an important minority 
community of Shi'i Muslims, who themselves today account for about 
10 per cent of the entire Muslim society of around one billion persons. 
The Isma'ilis have had a long and eventful history, stretching over 
more than 12 centuries, during which they became subdivided into a 
number of major branches and minor groupings. They came into 
existence, as a separate Shi'i community, around the middle of the 
eighth century; and, in mediaeval times, they twice founded states of 
their own, the Fatimid caliphate and the Nizari state. At the same time, 

Introduction 
the Isma'ilis played an important part in the religio-political and 
intellectual history of the Muslim world. The celebrated Isma'ili ddis 
or propagandists, who were at once theologians, philosophers and 
political emissaries, produced numerous treatises in diverse fields of 
learning, making their own contributions to the Islamic thought of 
mediaeval times. 
In 1094, the Isma'ili movement, which had enjoyed unity during the 
earlier Fatimid period, split into its two main branches, the Nizaris and 
the Mustalians. The Nizaris, who are the main object of this 
investigation, succeeded in founding a state in Persia, with a subsidiary 
in Syria. This territorially scattered state, centred on the mountain 
fortress of Alamut in northern Persia, maintained its cohesiveness in the 
midst of a hostile environment controlled by the overwhelmingly more 
powerful and anti-Shi'i Saljuq Turks, who championed the cause of 
Sunni Islam and its nominal spokesman, the Abbasid caliph at 
Baghdad. It was under such circumstances that the Syrian Nizaris were 
forced to confront a new adversary in the Christian Crusaders who, 
from 1096, had set out in successive waves to liberate the Holy Land of 
Christendom from the domination of the Muslims (or the Saracens as 
they were commonly but incorrectly called). The Nizari IsmaTli state, 
which controlled numerous mountain strongholds and their surround- 
ing villages as well as a few towns, finally collapsed in 1256 under the 
onslaught of the Mongols. Thereafter, the Nizaris of Persia, Syria and 
other lands survived merely as Shi'i minority communities without any 
political prominence. 
The western tradition of calling the Nizari Isma'ilis by the name of 
Assassins can be traced to the Crusaders and their Latin chroniclers as 
well as other occidental observers who had originally heard about these 
sectarians in the Levant. The name, or more appropriately misnomer, 
Assassin, which was originally derived under obscure circumstances 
from variants of the word hashish, the Arabic name for a narcotic 
product, and which later became the common occidental term for 
designating the Nizari Isma'ilis, soon acquired a new meaning in 
European languages; it was adopted as a common noun meaning 
murderer. However, the doubly pejorative appellation of Assassins 
continued to be utilized as the name of the Nizari Isma'ilis in western 
languages; and this habit was reinforced by Silvestre de Sacy and other 
prominent orientalists of the nineteenth century who had begun to 
produce the first scientific studies about the Isma'ilis. 
In more recent times, too, many western Islamists have continued to 
apply the ill-conceived term 'Assassins' to the Nizari Isma'ilis, perhaps 
without being consciously aware of its etymology or dubious origins. 

Bernard Lewis, the foremost modem authority on the history of the 
Syrian Nizaris and a scholar who has also concerned himself with the 
etymological aspects of the term Assassin, has consistently used it in his 
work, even adopting it for the title of his well-known monograph on 
the Nizari Isma'ilis.' Mashall Hodgson also used it in the title of his 
standard scholarly treatment of the subjea2 It is, therefore, not 
surprising that a non-specialist such as the famous English explorer 
Freya Stark (1893-1993), who visited Alamut in 1930, should have 
decided to use this term in the title of her romantic and still highly 
popular travelogue which, in fact, relates mainly to sites in Persia other 
than A l a mt .A similar choice was made by an Oxford expeditionary 
group of scholars who went to Persia in 1960 to conduct the most 
extensive archaeological investigation yet of the mdiaeval Nizari 
strongholds of northern Persia, even though they had the renowned 
Isma'ili specialist Samuel Stem (1920-69) as their historical advier.Indeed, despite the long-standing correct identification of the people in 
question as Nizari Isma'ilis, the appellation of Assassins has by and 
large been retained in the West. Doubtless, the term Assassins, with its 
aura of mystery and sensation, has acquired an independent currency. 
The myths and legends of the Nizari Isma'ilis, encouraged through- 
out the centuries by the retention of the name Assassins, seem to have 
had a similar history. Starting in the latter decades of the twelfth 
century, a number of inter-related legends began to circulate in the 
Latin Orient and Europe about this mysterious eastern sect, whose 
members had attracted attention because of their seemingly blind 
obedience to their leader, the 'Old Man of the Mountain'. Their self- 
sacrificing behaviour, carrying out dangerous missions at the behest of 
the 'Old Man', was soon attributed by their occidental observers to the 
influence of an intoxicating drug like hashish. This provided a rational 
explanation for behaviour that otherwise seemed irrational. The 
observers, however, had at best heard only fictitious details and 
distorted half-truths about the Nizaris from their numerous Muslim 
and Christian enemies in the Levant. Once the hashish connection was 
firmly established, it provided ample source material for yet more 
imaginative tales. The 'Old Man' was held to control the behaviour of 
his would-be assassins through regulated and systematic administration 
of some intoxicating potion like hashish, in conjunction with a secret 
'garden of paradise' in which his drugged devotees would temporarily 
enjoy the delights of an earthly paradise; hence, they would carry out 
the dangerous commands of their chief in order to experience such bliss 
in perpetuity. 
It did not take long for these legends to become fully elaborated and 

Introduction 
accepted as authentic descriptions of the secret practices of the Nizaris, 
who were now generally depicted in European sources as a sinister 
order of drugged and murderous Assassins. These popular legends were 
handed down from generation to generation, providing important 
source materials even for the more scholarly Isma'ili studies of the 
nineteenth-century orientalists, starting with Silvestre de Sacy who 
himself solved an important etymological mystery in this field, the 
connection between the words Assassin and hashish. Joseph von 
Hammer-Purgstall (1774-1856), the Austrian orientalist-diplomat who 
produced the first monograph in a European language on the Nizari 
Isma'ilis, had indeed accepted the authenticity of the Assassin legends 
whleheartedl.His book was treated as the standard account of the 
Nizaris of the Alamut period, at least until the 1930s. 
In the meantime, Muslim authors from early in the ninth century had 
generated their own myths of the Isma'ilis, especially regarding the 
origins and aims of the Isma'ili movement. In particular, Sunni 
Muslims, who were generally ill-informed about the internal divisions 
of Shi'ism and could not distinguish between the Isma'ilis and the 
dissident Qarmatis, wrote more polemical tracts against the Isma'ilis 
than any other Muslim group, also blaming the Isma'ili movement for 
the atrocities of the Qarmatis of Bahrayn. In time, the anti-Isma'ili 
polemicists themselves contributed significantly to shaping the hostility 
of Muslim society at large towards the Isma'ilis. 
By spreading their disparaging accounts widely from Transoxania to 
North Africa, aiming to discredit the entire Isma'ili movement, the 
Muslim polemicists gave rise to their own particular 'black legend' of 
Isma'ilism, which they portrayed as a sea with dubious founders and 
secret, graded initiation rites leading to irreligiosity and nihilism. 
Indeed, the most common feature of such anti-Isma'ili polemics, which 
greatly influenced all Islamic writings on the Isma'ilis until modern 
times, was the portrayal of Isma'ilism as an arch-heresy or ilhad, 
carefully designed to destroy Islam from within. It was further alleged 
that the Isma'ili imams, including especially the Fatimid caliphs, had 
falsely claimed Fatimid Alid descent from the Prophet's daughter 
Fatima and her husband Ali, the first Shi'i imam. Needless to say, the 
anti-Isma'ili sentiments of the polemicists also found expression in the 
writings of very many Muslim historians, theologians, jurists and 
heresiographers of mediaeval times, who rarely missed an opportunity 
to denounce the Isma'ilis and their doctrines. The anti-Isma'ili 'black 
legend' of the Muslim polemicists, and the general hostility of Muslim 
society towards the Isma'ilis, in time contributed to the westerners' 
imaginative tales about the Nizari Isma'ilis. 

The Isma'ilis themselves did not help matters by guarding their 
literature and refusing to divulge their doctrines to outsiders. They 
were, though, essentially justified in maintaining their secretiveness; in 
the Middle Ages the Isma'ilis were perhaps the most severely 
persecuted community within the Muslim world, subjected to mas- 
sacres in many localities. The Isma'ilis were, therefore, obliged from 
the beginning of their history to adhere closely to the Shi'i principle of 
taqiyya, precautionary dissimulation of one's true religious belief in the 
face of danger. In fact, with the major exception of the Fatimid period, 
when IsmaTli doctrines were preached openly in the Fatimid domi- 
nions, Isma'ilism developed in utmost secrecy and the Isma'ilis were 
coerced into what may be termed an underground or clandestine 
existence. In addition, the ddis who produced the bulk of the Isma'ili 
writings were mainly theologians and, as such, were not keen on 
historiography. All this, of course, provided ideal opportunities for the 
Isma'ilis' numerous adversaries to falsify and misrepresent their actual 
beliefs and practices. 
It was against this background that the orientalists of the nineteenth 
century, who had for the first time gained access to important 
collections of Islamic manuscripts held at major European libraries in 
Paris and elsewhere, began what promised to be a scientific study of the 
Isma'ilis. Unfortunately, they too achieved few results, mainly because 
they had no access to genuine Isma'ili texts and were therefore obliged 
to approach the subject from the narrow and fanciful viewpoint of the 
mediaeval Crusaders and the travesties of hostile Muslim authors. It is 
only against this literary background that one can read any sense into 
some of the conjectures and dubious inferences of Silvestre de Sacy 
(1758-1838), the greatest orientalist of the time, who summarized his 
main ideas on the Nizari Isma'ilis in his Mhoire sur la dynastie des 
Assassins (translated for the first time into English in the Appendix to 
this book). The distorted image of the Isma'ilis in general and the 
Nizari Isma'ilis in particular was maintained in orientalist circles until 
the opening decades of the twentieth century. A truly scholarly 
assessment of the Isma'ilis had to await the recovery and study of a 
large number of Isma'ili texts, a process that did not start until almost 
a century after de Sacy's death. It is due to the findings of modem 
scholarship that we are now finally in a position to distinguish fantasy 
or legend from reality in things Isma'ili, especially in connection with 
the Nizaris of the Alamut period who were the objects of the seminal 
Assassin legends. 
In the light of these findings, this study contends that the Assassin 
legends, especially those based on the hashish connection and the secret 

'garden of paradise', were actually fabricated and put into circulation 
by Europeans. It seems that the occidental observers of the Nizari 
Isma'ilis, especially those who were least informed about Islam and the 
Near East, generated these legends (initially in reference to the Syrian 
Nizaris) gradually and systematically, adding further components or 
embellishments in successive stages during the twelfth and thirteenth 
centuries. In this process, the Westerners, who in the Crusaders' times 
had a high disposition towards imaginative and romantic eastern tales, 
were greatly influenced by the biases and the general hostility of the 
non-Isma'ili Muslims towards the Ismaeilis, hostility which had earlier 
given rise to the anti-Isma'ili 'black legend' of the Sunni polemicists as 
well as some popular misconceptions about the Isma'ilis. In all 
probability, such popular misconceptions also circulated about the 
Nizaris in the non-literary local circles of the Latin East during the 
Crusaders' times; they would have been picked up by the Crusaders 
through their contact with rural Muslims working on their estates and 
the lesser educated Muslims of the towns, in addition to whatever 
information they could gather indirectly through the oriental Chris- 
tians. In this connection, it is significant to note that similar legends 
have not been found in any of the mediaeval Islamic sources, including 
contemporary histories of Syria. Indeed, educated Muslims, including 
their historians, did not fantasize at all about the secret practices of the 
Nizaris, even though they were hostile towards them. Similarly, those 
few well-informed occidental observers of the Syrian Nizaris, such as 
William of Tyre, who lived in the Latin East for long periods, did not 
contribute to the formation of the Assassin legends. 
In sum, it seems that the legends in question, though ultimately 
rooted in some popular lore and misinformation circulating locally, 
were actually formulated and transmitted rather widely due to their 
sensational appeal by the Crusaders and other western observers of the 
Nizaris; and they do, essentially, represent the 'imaginative construc- 
tions' of these uninformed observers.

## The Isma'ilis in History and in Mediaeval Muslim Writings
*Pages 11-51*

The Isma'ilis in History and in 
Mediaeval Muslim Writings 
The Isma'ilis represent an important sea of Shi'i Islam; and, like other 
Shi'i communities, they trace their history to the time of the Prophet 
Muhammad. The origins of Shi'ism and Sunnism, the two main 
divisions of Islam, lie in the crisis of succession in the nascent Islamic 
community following the death of the Prophet Muhammad in Medina 
on 8 June 632. According to the message of Islam, Muhammad was the 
Seal of the Prophets, and, therefore, he could not be succeeded by 
another prophet. A successor was, nevertheless, needed to assume the 
Prophet's function as leader of the Islamic community and state, the 
foundations of which had essentially been laid during the last decade of 
Muhammad's prophetic mission. As the Prophet himself had not 
designated any successor, in the view of the majority, this important 
appointment now had to be made. After brief deliberations by the 
leading Muslim groups, the communal choice fell on Abu Bakr, who 
now became khalifat rasul Allah, Successor to the Messenger of God. 
The title for the head of the Muslim community was soon simplified to 
khalifa, hence the term 'caliph' in western languages.' 
Abu Bakr led the Muslims for just over two years. The next three 
heads of the Muslim community, Umar (634-44), Uthman (644-56) 
and Ali (656-61), were also installed to office by various elective 
procedures. These four early caliphs all belonged to the influential 
Meccan mbe of Quraysh and they also ranked among those early 
converts to Islam and the Companions of the Prophet who had accom- 
panied Muhammad on his historic emigration from Mecca to Medina 
in 622, which was to mark the initiation of the Islamic era. But only the 
fourth caliph, Ali, who occupies a unique position in the annals of 
ShiTsm, belonged to the Banu Hashim, the Prophet's own clan of 
Quraysh; he was also closely related to the Prophet, being his cousin 
and son-in-law, bound in matrimony to the Prophet's daughter Fatima. 

The lsmacilis in History and in Mediaeval Muslim Writings 
Ali's caliphate was a period of strife and civil war, resulting in 
irreconcilable religio-political divisions within the Muslim community, 
later designated specifically as Sunni, Shi'i and Khariji.2 In particular, 
Ali's authority was challenged by Mucawiya, the powerful governor of 
Syria who belonged to the wealthy Meccan clan of the Banu Umayya. 
When Ali was murdered in 661, the caliphate was readily seized by the 
shrewd Mucawiya who also succeeded in establishing the hereditary 
rule of the Umayyads (661-750), the first dynasty in Islam. 
The Umayyads, under whom the Islamic empire acquired its full 
extent, were supplanted in a well-designed revolution by the Abbasids, 
who were from the Hashimite Banu Abbas family of the Prophet's 
uncle Abbas. The Abbasids ruled for almost five centuries over different 
parts of the Muslim world and with various degrees of independent 
caliphal authority, from their capital at Baghdad, until they were 
overthrown in 1258 by the Mongols, soon after the Mongol destruc- 
tion of the Nizari Isma'ili state in Persia. 
The doctrinal basis of Sunnism, representing a particular interpre- 
tation of the Islamic message by the Muslim majority who had also 
supported the historical caliphate, developed gradually, like that of 
Shi'ism. By the early Abbasid centuries, the Sunni Muslims, represent- 
ing the central body of the community and designated in Arabic as the 
Ah1 al-Sunna wa'l-lama'a (People of the Sunna and of the Commun- 
ity), and the various Shi'i communities had already begun to possess 
their distinctive theological doctrines and schools of religious law, 
based primarily on the holy Quran and the Sunna (actions and sayings 
of the Prophet) and certain other foundations. 
Immediately on the death of the Prophet, there had appeared a small 
group in Medina who believed that the succession was the legitimate 
right of his cousin and son-in-law, Ali b. Abi Talib. In time, this 
minority group expanded and came to be generally designated as the 
Shr'at Ali (Party of Ali), or simply as the Shi'a. Due to the lack of 
contemporary sources on the first century of Islam, the history of the 
formative period of Shi'ism is shrouded in obscurity, and later sources 
on the subject are unreliable due to their Sunni biases, Shi'i sympathies, 
or retrospective stances. Be that as it may, it is the fundamental belief of 
the Shi'a, including the Isma'ilis, that the Prophet had, in fact, 
designated Ali as his legatee (wasi) and successor; a designation or nus 
that had been instituted by divineommand.The Shi'a further held that after Ali, the leadership of the Muslim 
community was the exclusive right of Ali's descendants, the Alids, who 
belonged to the Prophet's family or the ah1 al-bayt. Thus, the rules of 
the first three caliphs as well as those of the Umayyads and the 

Abbasids, constituted an arbitrary usurpation of the rights of Ali and 
his descendants, the dispossessed legitimate imams, as the Shi'a have 
always preferred to call the leaders of the Muslim community. This 
explains why most Shi'i groups accused the majority of the early 
Companions of the Prophet of apostasy, which also led to the ShiT 
vilification of the first three caliphs. Thus, the intense desire to see 
justice restored by installing the Alids to the leadership of the 
community became the moving force behind numerous Shi'i revolts of 
the Umayyad and early Abbasid times. Meanwhile, the Sunnis had 
adopted their own antiShi'i measures, such as the cursing of Ali from 
the pulpits of mosques after Friday prayers, a policy instituted by 
Mu'awiya. Many of the Alids and their supporters from different Shi'i 
communities were also persecuted on the orders of the Sunni rulers. 
The Shi'i viewpoint outlined here was rooted also in a particular 
conception of religious authority, which has continued to occupy a 
central position in Shi'i spirituality and thought. According to this 
conception, the most important question facing the Muslim community 
after the Prophet was the elucidation of Islamic teachings and tenets, 
since the Islamic message emanated from sources beyond the compre- 
hension of ordinary men. From the very beginning the Shi'a had 
recognized the need for a religiously authoritative teacher and spiritual 
guide, or imam, after the Prophet. Hence, the Shi'a saw in this 
leadership a vital spiritual function connected with the explanation and 
interpretation of the true meaning of the Islamic revelation. Now, a 
person with a thorough knowledge of both the apparent and the hidden 
meanings of the Quran and the teachings of Islam had to be in 
possession of a special religious knowledge or ilm, not available to 
ordinary men; and such authoritative guides could belong only to the 
ah1 al-bayt who, beginning with Ali himself, were inheritors of the 
Prophet's undivulged teachings and ilm. 
The Shi'a were numerically small, but their zeal and unwavering 
loyalty to Ali and his descendants explain how Shi'ism managed to 
survive Ali himself and numerous subsequent defeats during its 
formative period. Soon, Shi'ism acquired lasting roots among the 
heterogeneous population of Kufa in southern Iraq. It was also in or 
around Kufa that the main events in the early history of Shi'ism 
unfolded, events that in various ways contributed to the formation of 
the Shi'i ethos and the eventual consolidation of Shi'ism as a dynamic 
movement with a distinct ideology. 
On Ali's death, the Shi'a recognized his eldest son Hasan as their 
new imam. Meanwhile, Hasan had also been acclaimed as caliph, in 
succession to Ali, in Kufa. However, Mu'awiya speedily succeeded in 

The Isma'ilis in History and in Mediaeval Muslim Writings 
inducing Hasan's abdication from the caliphate. On Hasan's death in 
669, the Shi'a revived their hope for challenging Umayyad rule through 
their next imam, Husayn, the second son of Ali and Fatima and 
Hasan's full brother. Husayn eventually responded to the Kufan 
summons and set off on his fateful journey from the Hijaz to Iraq. The 
tragic martyrdom of the Prophet's grandson Husayn and his small band 
of relatives and companions at Karbala, near Kufa, where they were 
massacred by an Umayyad army on 10 October 680, marked the 
establishment of the all-important Shi'i martyrology. This event 
infused an entirely new religious fervour into the Shi'a and led to the 
formation of radical trends among the partisans of Ali and the ah1 al- 
bayt. The earliest of such radical trends, which left lasting marks on 
Shi'ism, became openly manifest a few years later in the movement of 
al-Mukhtar. 
Al-Mukhtar b. Abi Ubayd organized his own anti-regime, Shi'i 
movement, with a general call for avenging Husayn's murder. In 685, 
al-Mukhtar successfully revolted in Kufa and proclaimed Muhammad, 
a third son of Ali, as the imam. However, Muhammad, who was not 
the son of Fatima, and was known after his own mother as Ibn al- 
Hanafiyya, remained a figurehead in al-Mukhtar's movement. Al- 
Mukhtar also proclaimed Ibn al-Hanafiyya as the Mahdi, 'the divinely 
guided one', the messianic restorer of Islam and the saviour imam who 
would establish justice on earth and deliver the oppressed from 
tyranny. This new eschatological concept of the imam-Mahdi proved 
particularly appealing to the mawali or clients, the non-Arab converts 
to Islam, who now swarmed to al-Mukhtar's side, calling themselves 
the Shfat al-Mahdi (Party of the Mahdi). The success of al-Mukhtar, 
who speedily won control of Kufa, however, proved short-lived, 
although his movement survived under the name of Mukhtariyya, later 
commonly designated as Kaysaniyya. 
By contrast to the first half-century in the history of Shi'ism, when 
the Shi'a represented a unified Arab party and accorded general 
recognition to a single succession of imams (namely, Ali, Hasan and 
Husayn), henceforth different Shi'i groups consisting of Arabs and 
rnawali came to co-exist. Furthermore, the Shi'i imams now issued not 
only primarily from among the three major branches of the extended 
Alid family, namely, the Hanafids (descendants of Muhammad b. al- 
Hanafiyya who died in 700), the Husaynids (descendants of Husayn 
b. Ali) and, later, the Hasanids (descendants of Hasan b. Ali), but also 
from among other branches of the Prophet's clan of Banu Hashim; 
because the Prophet's family, whose sanctity was supreme for the 
Shi'is, was then still defined broadly in its old tribal sense. It was after 

the accession of the Abbasids that the Shi'is began to define the ah1 
al-bayt more restrictively to include only the direct descendants of the 
Prophet through Fatima (and Ali), known as the Fatirnids (covering 
both the Hasanid and the Husaynid Alids), and the bulk of the Shi'a, 
including the Isma'ilis, came to acknowledge a particular Husaynid 
line of imams. 
In this divided and fluid setting, Shi'ism developed in terms of two 
main branches or trends; and later another Alid movement led to the 
formation of a Shi'i sect known as the Zaydiyya. A radical branch, in 
terms of both doctrine and policy, evolved out of al-Mukhtar's 
movement and accounted for the allegiance of the Shi'i majority until 
shortly after the Abbasid revolution. This branch, breaking away from 
the religiously moderate attitude prevailing among the early Kufan 
Shi'a and generally designated as the Kaysaniyya by the heresio- 
graphers, was comprised of a number of inter-connected groups 
following various Hanafid Alids and other Hashimites as their imams. 
By the end of the Umayyad period, the majority body of the 
Kaysaniyya, notably the Hashimiyya, transferred their allegiance to the 
Abbasid family. With this transference, the Abbasids also inherited the 
party and the propaganda organization which became the main 
instruments for the eventual overthrow of the Umayyads.4 
The Kaysaniyya drew mainly on the support of the superficially 
Islamicized mawali, non-Arab clients in southern Iraq and elsewhere 
who were treated as second-class Muslims under the Umayyads. The 
mawali played a significant part in transforming Shi'ism from an Arab 
party of limited size and doctrinal basis to a dynamic sectarian 
movement. The Kaysani Shi'is elaborated some of the beliefs and 
doctrines which came to characterize the radical branch of Shi'ism. 
Many of the Kaysani ideas were propounded by the so-called ghulat, 
'exaggerators', who were accused by the more moderate Shi'is of later 
times of exaggeration in religious matters. The early ShiT gbulat 
speculated rather freely on a host of issues and they were responsible 
for many doctrinal innovations, including the spiritual interpretations 
of the Day of Judgement, Resurrection, Paradise and Hell; they also 
held a cyclical view of the religious history of mankind in terms of eras 
initiated by different prophets. Much of the intellectual heritage of the 
Kaysaniyya was subsequently absorbed into the doctrines of the main 
Shi'i communities. 
Meanwhile, there had appeared a second major branch or wing of 
Shi'ism, later designated as the Imamiyya. This branch, with its limited 
original following, remained completely removed from any anti-regime 
political activity. The Imami Shi'is, who were centred in Kufa, 

The Isrna'ilis in History and in Mediaeval Muslim Writings 13 
recognized a line of Husaynid imams after Ali, Hasan and Husayn, 
tracing the imamate through Husayn's sole surviving son Ali b. 
Husayn, who received the honorific epithet of Zayn al-Abidin, 'the 
Ornament of the Pious'. 
It was with Zayn al-Abidin's son, Muhammad al-Baqir, that the 
Husaynid imams and the Imamiyya began to acquire their particular 
identity and prominence within the Shi'a. During the final Umayyad 
decades, with the rise of different theological and legal schools 
upholding conflicting views, many Shi'is sought the guidance of their 
imam as an authoritative teacher. Al-Baqir was the first imam of the 
Husaynid line fully to perform this role, and he acquired an increasing 
group of followers who regarded him as the sole legitimate religious 
authority of the time. In line with his quiescent policy, al-Baqir is also 
credited with introducing the important Shi'i principle of taqiyya, 
precautionary dissimulation of one's true religious beliefs in the face of 
danger. This principle was adopted by the Ithna'ashari or Twelver and 
Isma'ili Shi'is, and it particularly served to save the Isma'ilis from 
much persecution throughout the centuries. Having laid the founda- 
tions of Imami Shi'ism, the common heritage of the great Shi'i 
communities of Ithna'ashariyya and Isma'iliyya, Muhammad al-Baqir 
died around 732, almost a century after the death of the Prophet. 
The Imamiyya expanded significantly and became an important 
religious community under al-Baqir's son and successor Ja'far al-Sadiq, 
who was the foremost scholar and teacher among the imams of the 
Husaynid line. Early in alSadiq7s long and eventful imamate of some 
30 or more years, his uncle Zayd b. Ali's movement unfolded. Zayd, 
too, was persuaded by the Kufans to lead them in an anti-Umayyad 
revolt. Zayd's revolt, launched in Kufa in 740, proved abortive, as the 
Kufans once again manifested their unreliability. However, Zayd's 
movement led to the formation of another major Shi'i sect, the 
Zaydiyya, who, unlike the Imamiyya, did not recognize a hereditary 
line of imams. The Zaydis retained the religiously moderate and 
politically militant stances of the early Kufan Shi'a. They were 
conservative in defining the religious status of their imams, who could 
be any descendants of Hasan or Husayn, and they also refrained from 
condemning the early caliphs before Ali and the rest of the Muslim 
community for having failed to acknowledge the legitimate rights of Ali 
and his descendants. Politically, the Zaydis adopted a militant position, 
advocating armed uprising against the illegitimate rulers of the time. By 
the second half of the ninth century, the Zaydis had succeeded in 
establishing two states, one in Tabaristan and adjacent regions on the 
southern coast of the Caspian Sea in northern Persia, and another one 

in Yaman. In both regions there were, subsequently, extended rivalries 
and numerous military encounters between the Zaydis and their 
neighbouring Isma'ili communities. 
Meanwhile, the Abbasids had learned important lessons from the 
abortive revolts of the Umayyad period. Paying particular attention to 
the organizational aspects of their own secret revolutionary movement, 
the Abbasid religio-political mission or ddwa was preached in the 
name of the ah1 al-bayt and on a largely Shi'i basis. At any rate, in 750, 
the Abbasids installed their own dynasty to the caliphate to the great 
disappointment of the Shi'is who had all along expected the Alids to 
succeed the Umayyads as the new rulers of the Muslim community. 
Shi'i disillusionment was further aggravated when the Abbasids, soon 
after their victory, became staunch supporters of Sunni Islam, adopting 
repressive measures against the Alids and their Shi'i supporters. 
It was under these circumstances that Ja'far al-Sadiq emerged as the 
main rallying point for the allegiance of the Shi'is. Maintaining the 
Imami tradition of remaining aloof from any revolutionary activity, 
Ja'far alSadiq had gradually acquired a widespread reputation as a 
religious scholar and teacher, and, besides his own partisans, large 
numbers of Muslims studied or consulted with him. In time, he also 
acquired a circle of Imami associates which included some of the most 
learned scholars and theologians of the time. As a result of the intensive 
intellectual efforts of this circle, led by alSadiq himself, the Imamiyya 
now came to possess a distinctive legal school, as well as a body of 
ritual and theological thought. 
The fundamental doctrine of Imami thought, however, has been the 
doctrine of the imamate which was formulated in alSadiq's time. It 
was based on the belief in the permanent need of mankind for a 
divinely guided, sinless and infallible (maesum) leader or imam who, 
after the Prophet Muhammad, would act as the authoritative teacher 
and guide of men in all their religious and spiritual affairs. This imam is 
also endowed with special knowledge or ilm, and has perfect 
understanding of all the exoteric and esoteric aspects of the Quran and 
the message of Islam. Indeed, the world could not exist for a moment 
without such an imam after the age of the prophets, which was sealed 
by Muhammad. Recognition of the true imam and obedience to him 
were made the absolute duty of every believer; and the ignorance or 
rejection of such an imam would be equal to infidelity. The Prophet 
himself had designated Ali as his successor, under divine command. 
After Ali, Hasan and Husayn, the imamate had remained vested in the 
Husaynid line; and after Ja'far alSadiq, it would be transmitted 
through his progeny until the end of time. 

The Ismacilis in History and in Mediaeval Muslim Writings 15 
Imam Ja'far alSadiq, the last imam recognized by both the Twelvers 
and the Isma'ilis, died in 765. The dispute over his succession led to 
permanent divisions within Imami Shi'ism, also marking the appear- 
ance of Isma'ilism as an independent religio-political movement, which 
was initially comprised of a number of small Kufan groups. 
Early or pre-Fatimid Isma'ilism, extending from the proto-Isma'ili 
origins of the movement in the middle of the eighth century to the 
establishment of the Fatimid caliphate in 909, is the most obscure 
major phase in the entire history ofsma'ilism.Little reliable 
information is available on the history and doctrines of the pre-Fatimid 
Isma'ilis, who laid the intellectual foundations of Isma'ilism and 
successfully disseminated their religio-political preaching or da'wa in 
many Islamic lands, while their survival was continuously threatened 
by the persecutions of the Abbasids. The early Isma'ilis themselves 
seem to have produced very few treatises, preferring instead to 
propagate their doctrines by word of mouth. Research difficulties are 
further aggravated by the general dearth of information on Shi'ism 
during the early Abbasid period, when the major Twelver and Isma'ili 
communities were being formed. 
As a result, despite the modern recovery of mediaeval Isma'ili 
literature, the early Isma'ilis still have to be studied mainly on the basis 
of non-Ismaeili sources, which are generally very hostile. Among these, 
heresiographies provide an important category, especially the accounts 
of the Imami (Twelver) scholars al-Nawbakhti and al-Qummi, who 
were rather well-informed about the internal divisions of Shi'ism and 
were basically interested in proving the legitimacy of their own line of 
imams while refuting the claims of those imams recognized by the 
Isma'ilis and other non-Twelver Shi'i groups.6 
Imam Ja'far alSadiq had designated his eldest son, Isma'il, as his 
successor to the imamate. But, according to the majority of non- 
Isma'ili sources, Isma'il predeceased his father; subsequently, al-Sadiq 
does not seem to have made a clear second designation or nass in 
favour of another son. This explains why, on alSadiq's death, three of 
his sons, including Musa (later recognized as the seventh imam of the 
Twelver Shi'a), as well as his eldest grandson Muhammad b. Isma'il, 
simultaneously claimed his heritage. At any rate, in 765 the Imami Shi'i 
community, centred in Kufa, split into six groups, two of which 
constituted the nascent Ismaeiliyya. 
The two earliest Isma'ili groups acknowledging the imamate of 
Isma'il b. Ja'far al-Sadiq or that of his son Muhammad b. Isma'il, 
now issued from the Imamiyya. One group, denying the death of 
Isma'il during the lifetime of his father, maintained that Isma'il was al- 

Sadiq's rightful successor, and that he remained alive and would return 
as the Mahdi. The Imami heresiographers, who are actually responsible 
for coining the designation of 'Isma'iliyya', refer to this group as al- 
Isma'iljya al-khalisa, or the 'Pure IsmaTliyya'. There was a second 
group of the earliest Isma'ilis who, affirming Isma'il's death during his 
father's lifetime, now acknowledged Isma'il's eldest son Muhammad as 
their new imam. This group was known as the Mubarakiyya, originally 
named after Mubarak, one of Isma'il's epithets. The exact nature of the 
relationship between these two splinter groups, which were based in 
Kufa and were numerically rather insignificant, remains obscure. On 
the death of Muhammad b. Isma'il, not too long after 795, the 
Mubarakiyya themselves split into two groups. The bulk of the 
Mubarakiyya, refusing to accept Muhammad b. Isma'il's death, now 
began to await his return as the Mahdi. For these sectarians, 
comprising the largest of the three earliest Isma'ili groups, Muhammad 
b. Isma'il was their seventh and final imam. This also explains why the 
Isma'iliyya later acquired the denomination of the Sab'iyya or 
Seveners. Meanwhile, a small and obscure subgroup of the Mubarak- 
iyya had accepted Muhammad b. Isma'il's death and had traced the 
imamate in his progeny. 
The Imami (Twelver) authorities, who aimed to discredit the 
Isma'ilis, generally identify the nascent Isma'iliyya with the extremist 
Shi'i ghulat, notably the Khattabiyya. However, later Fatimid Isma'ili 
sources actually repudiated Abu'l-Khattab, the founder of the Khatta- 
biyya, as a heretic, also denouncing his group. Indeed, fundamental 
differences existed in the doctrinal field between the views of the early 
Isma'ilis, who retained the Imami doctrine of the imamate as 
expounded by Ja'far al-Sadiq, and the Khattabis who believed in the 
divinity of the imams in addition to upholding other extremist views. In 
the political field, however, the earliest Isma'ilis did share the 
revolutionary ideals of the Khattabis and some other radical groups on 
the fringe of the Imamiyya. All these groups, belonging to a politically 
activist wing in the Imami milieu of Kufa, worked for the collapse of 
Abbasid rule; and, as such, they departed from the quiescent policy 
espoused by the teachings of the Imamiyya. 
Muhammad b. Isma'il, unlike his father, was not personally involved 
in any revolutionary activity. Nevertheless, in order to escape from the 
Abbasid persecution of the Shi'i leaders and the Alids, he, too, was 
obliged to leave the seat of the Alid family in the Hijaz and go into 
hiding soon after alSadiq's death. This, in effect, initiated the long 
period of concealment (dawr al-satr) in the history of the early 
Isma'ilis, lasting until the establishment of the Fatimid caliphate; a 

The Isma'ilis in History and in Mediaeval Muslim Writings 17 
period which provided the anti-Isma'ili Muslim authors of mediaeval 
times with an ideal opportunity to invent hostile tales about the origins 
of Ismaeilism. 
Not much is known about the subsequent fate of the earliest Isma'ili 
groups until the sudden emergence of a unified Isma'ili movement 
shortly after the middle of the ninth century. Ismaeilism now appeared 
as a well organized and centrally led revolutionary movement with an 
elaborate doctrinal system; and its message was rapidly and secretly 
disseminated by a network of missionaries called da'is (summoners) 
throughout much of the Islamic world. The movement was now 
preached in the name of the absent Muhammad b. Isma'il, recognized 
as the expected Mahdi, or qa'im (Riser). It was held that Muhammad 
b. Ismaeil had gone into hiding and that on his imminent reappearance 
he would establish justice in the world and initiate the final, seventh era 
of human history. The early Isma'ilis had also developed a cyclical 
view of religious history and a particular cosmological system.' It is to 
be noted that the pre-Fatimid Isma'ilis evidently never referred to 
themselves as Isma'ilis; they designated their movement simply as al- 
ddwa, 'the mission', or al-da'wa al-hadiya, 'the rightly guiding 
mission', reflecting the elitist attitude of the sectarians and their divine 
duty to invite other Muslims into their midst. They were soon generally 
designated by their contemporaries with the abusive term malahida 
(heretics). 
It is certain that during this early period of Isma'ili history, from 
Muhammad b. Isma'il's death until the middle of the ninth century, a 
group of central leaders worked patiently and secretly for the creation 
of a unified and expanded Isma'ili movement. These leaders, members 
of the same family who succeeded to the leadership of the movement on 
a hereditary basis, had been originally attached to one of the earliest 
Isma'ili groups, and were in all probability the imams of one of the two 
subgroups into which the Mubarakiyya had split on the death of 
Muhammad b. IsmaT1. At any rate, these leaders, observing taqiyya to 
safeguard themselves, did not at the time openly claim the imamate; 
instead, they adopted the guise of the hujjas or representatives of 
Muhammad b. Isma'il, on whose behalf the movement was organized. 
They also adopted cover names, such as Maymun (the Blessed) to 
protect further their true identities, which were actually known only by 
a few trusted associates. These points are clearly explained by Abd 
Allah (Ubayd Allah) al-Mahdi, the last of these early leaders and the 
future founder of the Fatimid caliphate, in a letter to the Isma'ili 
community of yaman.* 

The efforts of these leaders finally bore fruit around the year 873, 
when the Abbasid caliphate had already begun to disintegrate. Around 
that time numerous da'is appeared in Iraq, Yaman, eastern Arabia and 
in many localities in Persia, rapidly winning an increasing number of 
converts. The successful propagation of the Isma'ili da'wa aroused the 
enmity of the caliphs at Baghdad and their Sumi supporters; it also 
aroused the envy of the Imami Shi'is, who were soon to become 
designated as the Ithna'ashariyya or Telvers.This was not only 
because these two Shi'i communities acknowledged different lines of 
imams after al-Sadiq, but also because as upholders of the same 
doctrine of the imamate each community regarded its own imams as 
the sole legitimate leaders of the Muslim community. The revolution- 
ary, messianic movement of the early Isma'ilis achieved special success 
among those Imami Shi'is who had become increasingly disenchanted 
with the quietism and political inactivity of their own imams. All this 
may also explain why al-Fad1 b. Shadhan, the great Imami scholar of 
Nishapur who died in 873, wrote the earliest known refutation of the 
Isma'ilis. 
It was under such circumstances that the Isma'ili da'wa in Iraq was 
initiated and placed under the local leadership of Hamdan Qarmat and 
his chief assistant Abdan. Hamdan won many converts in Iraq, who 
became known as the Qaramita (singular, Qarmati), named after their 
first local leader. Soon, the same term came to be applied to other 
sections of the Isma'ili movement which were not organized or led by 
Hamdan Qarmat. The Isma'ili da'wa was extended to many other 
regions outside Iraq during the 870s. After his initial career in southern 
Persia, the da'i Abu Sa'id al-Jannabi was sent by Hamdan to Bahrayn 
where he eventually founded a state in 899. In 879, the central 
leadership of the Isma'ili movement sent two da'is to Yaman, where 
they achieved lasting success based on strong tribal support. It was also 
from Yaman that the da'i Abu Abd Allah al-Shi'i was sent to the 
Maghrib, where Isma'ilism was preached successfully among the 
Kutama Berbers and the ground was prepared for the establishment 
there of the Fatimid caliphate. Around 873, the IsmaTli da'wa also 
appeared in many parts of central and north-western Persia, the region 
of the Jibal, where the da'is established their local headquarters at 
Rayy; and about three decades later, around 903, the da'wa was 
officially taken to Khurasan and Transoxania, where for a while it 
penetrated the inner circles of the Samanid court atukhara.'' 
Between the middle of the ninth century and the year 899, Isma'ilism 
represented a unified movement, preaching the Mahdiship of Muham- 
mad b. Ismacil. Hamdan Qarmat and other local chief da'is had 

The Isma'ilis in History and in Mediaeval Muslim Writings 19 
maintained correspondence with the central leaders of Isma'ilism, who 
then resided at Salamiyya, in Syria, and whose identity remained a 
closely guarded secret. In 899 the Isma'ili movement was rent by a 
major schism shortly after Abd Allah (Ubayd Allah), the future Fatimid 
caliph al-Mahdi, had succeeded to its central leadership." Abd Allah 
felt secure enough openly to claim the imamate for himself and his 
predecessors, who had actually organized and led the Isma'ili move- 
ment during the ninth century. He soon instructed Hamdan and other 
chief &is of different lands to start preaching the &wa in his own 
name, instead of recognizing the Mahdiship of Muhammad b. Isma'il. 
Abd Allah (Ubayd Allah) al-Mahdi's declarations split the unified 
Isma'ili movement into two rival branches in 899. One branch, 
consisting mainly of the Isma'ili communities of Yaman, Egypt and 
North Africa, remained loyal to Abd Allah and accepted his claim that 
the imamate had been uninterruptedly handed down among his 
ancestors. This loyalist branch now recognized a series of 'hidden 
imams', between Ja'far al-Sadiq and Abd Allah al-Mahdi, identified 
with the central leaders who had actually led the movement; and, 
subsequently, they traced the imamate among the descendants of Abd 
Allah who ruled as Fatimid caliphs. Indeed, it was the loyalist branch, 
designated as the Fatimid Isma'ilis, that soon prepared the ground for 
the rule of the Isma'ili imams as Fatimid caliphs. On the other hand, 
some of the chief &is of the eastern communities, led by Hamdan and 
Abdan, refused to accept Abd Allah's claims; they either suspended 
their &wa activities or continued to retain their original belief in the 
Mahdiship of Muhammad b. Isma'il. Abu Sa'id al-Jannabi, who 
established his rule over Bahrayn in the same eventful year of 899, 
sided with Hamdan Qarmat and severed his relations with Abd Allah. 
This dissident branch eventually encompassed the Isma'ili communities 
of Iraq and Bahrayn, as well as most of those situated in the Jibal, 
Khurasan and Transoxania. Henceforth, the term Qaramita came to be 
applied more specifically to the dissident Isma'ilis of Bahrayn and 
elsewhere who did not acknowledge Abd Allah al-Mahdi and his 
predecessors, as well as his successors in the Fatimid dynasty, as imams. 
However, with the devastating and antinomian activities of the 
Qarmatis of Bahrayn, who for a long time led the dissident wing, 
Muslim authors came to apply the term Qaramita in a derogatory sense 
to the entire Isma'ili movement, which they aimed to discredit. 
Soon, the dissident Qarmatis began to manifest their hostility openly 
towards the Fatimid Isma'ilis and their imam, obliging Abd Allah al- 
Mahdi to flee from Salamiyya in 902 and embark on his long and 
historic journey to North Africa. There, through the extended efforts of 

the da'i Abu Abd Allah al-Shi'i and his Kutama Berber converts to 
Isma'ilism, Abd Allah al-Mahdi eventually made his triumphant entry 
into Raqqada, the former capital of the Aghlabids in Ifriqiya (Tunisia), 
where he was publicly proclaimed as caliph in January 910. The new 
caliphate was named al-Fatimiyyun, after the Prophet's daughter 
Fatima, whom Abd Allah al-Mahdi and his successors claimed as 
ancestress. 
The Fatimid period (910-1171) was the 'golden age' of the Isma'ili 
movement. During this period the classical works of Isma'ili literature 
were composed by the renowned Isma'ili da'i-authors. At the same 
time, the Isma'ilis had for the first time acquired an important dawla or 
state of their own. At its peak, the Fatimid caliphate included all of 
North Africa, Sicily, Egypt, the Red Sea coast of Africa, Yaman, the 
Hijaz with the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, Syria and Palestine. 
Isma'ili doctrines were now preached openly throughout the Fatimid 
dominions, where the Isma'ilis no longer had to resort to taqiyya or 
dissimulation. After transferring the seat of their state from Ifriqiya to 
Egypt in 973, the Isma'ilis also paid considerable attention to Islamic 
sciences as well as economic and cultural activities in general, whlle 
maintaining a flourishing trade with India and many other lands. The 
newly founded Fatimid capital, Cairo, rivalled Abbasid Baghdad as the 
international metropolis of the Islamic world. The Isma'ilis had now 
truly emerged triumphant from their clandestine existence in pre- 
Fatimid times.12 
The Fatimids, unlike the Abbasids, did not discontinue their da'wa 
activities in the aftermath of their victory. On the contrary, their da'wa 
was intensified because they never abandoned their aspiration to rule 
the entire Muslim world. This explains why the Fatimids continued to 
refer to their missionary activities as al-da'wa al-hadiya, the rightly 
guiding summons to mankind to follow the Fatimid Isma'ili imam. It 
should be pointed out, however, that the Fatimids, in line with a 
general Isma'ili position, were never interested in mass or forced 
conversions. 
The organization and evolution of the Fatimid da'wa, as well as 
the scope and functions of the various ranks (hudud) within that 
complex organization, are among the most obscure aspects of Fatimid 
Isma'ilism. Organized hierarchically, the Fatimid da'wa evolved over 
time, attaining a definite shape during the reign of the Fatimid caliph- 
imam al-Hakim (996-1021) who established several institutions in 
Egypt for the training of &is and propagation of Isma'ili doctrines. 
The Fatimid da'is were in general highly educated theologians who 
also produced the bulk of Isma'ili literature of the Fatimid period. 

The Ismaeilis in History and in Mediaeval Muslim Writings 21 
Although nothing is known about the procedures they used for winning 
and educating new converts, it is certain that different methods were 
adopted for peoples of different religious and socio-cultural back- 
grounds. The ddis seem to have treated each case individually, also 
observing a certain degree of gradualism in the initiation and education 
of converts. But there is no evidence to suggest, as claimed by anti- 
Isma'ili sources, that there ever existed at any time a fixed graded 
system of seven or nine degrees of initiation intosma'ilism.'Meanwhile, the Qarmatis of Bahrayn, like the Qarmati communities 
of Iraq, Persia and Transoxania, had continued to await the reappear- 
ance of Muhammad b. Isma'il as their expected Mahdi. Starting in 
923, when Abu Tahir al-Jannabi had already succeeded to the 
leadership in Bahrayn, the Qarmatis of eastern Arabia began their 
prolonged career of raiding southern Iraq and pillaging the hajj 
caravans returning from Mecca. In one of their military campaigns 
against the Abbasids in 927, the Qarmatis of Bahrayn came dose to 
seizing Baghdad itself. The ravaging activities of Abu Tahir culminated 
in his sack of Mecca, where he arrived at the head of a Qarmati army in 
930, during the pilgrimage season. For several days the Qarmatis 
massacred the pilgrims and committed numerous acts of desecration. 
They finally dislodged and carried off the Black Stone of the Kaeba to 
their new capital, al-Ahsa, presumably to symbolize the end of the era 
of Islam. The sacrilege of the Qarmatis at Mecca shocked the entire 
Muslim world. 
In 931, Abu Tahir turned over the reins of the state in Bahrayn to a 
young Persian in whom he had recognized the expected Mahdi. 
However, this proved to be a disastrous decision for the Qarmati 
movement. Manifesting strong anti-Arab and antinomian sentiments, 
he cursed Muhammad and other prophets in addition to instituting a 
number of strange ceremonies that further shocked the Muslims. At 
any rate, after some 80 days, when the Persian Mahdi had begun to 
execute the notables of Bahrayn, Abu Tahir was obliged to admit that 
the Mahdi had been an imposter, and had him killed. The episode of 
the Persian Mahdi further damaged the image of the Qarmatis of 
Bahrayn and weakened their influence over the Qarmati communities 
in the East. 
In Bahrayn itself, in the aftermath of the episode of the Persian 
Mahdi, the Qarmatis had reverted to their former beliefs and Abu 
Tahir once again claimed to be acting on the orders of the hidden 
Mahdi. Soon he also resumed his devastating activities, plundering the 
pilgrim caravans and conducting military raids for booty into Iraq and 
southern Persia. He died in 944. The Qarmatis finally returned the 

Black Stone in 951 for a large sum paid by the Abbasids, not, as stated 
in some anti-Isma'ili sources, in response to the request of the Fatimid 
caliph-imam al-Mansur (946-53). Hostilities between the Qarmatis of 
Bahrayn and the Fatimids broke into open warfare during the reign of 
the Fatimid caliph-imam al-Mu'izz (953-73, in the aftermath of the 
Fatimid conquest of Egypt in 969. 
The Qarmatis of Bahrayn, indeed, frustrated a quick Fatimid victory 
in Syria, also providing serious impediments to the extension of Fatimid 
rule over the eastern Abbasid lands beyond Syria. By the end of the 
tenth century, the Qarmatis of Bahrayn had been reduced to a local 
power, and little is known about their subsequent history. By the 
middle of the eleventh century, the Qarmati communities of Iraq, Persia 
and Transoxania had been largely won over to the side of the Fatimid 
ddwa, or they had disintegrated. In 1077, a local tribal chief put a 
definite end to the Qarmati state of Bahrayn, founding the Uyunid 
dynasty of eastern Arabia." 
Much has been written in modem times about the relations between 
the Qarmatis and the Fatimids. Michael Jan de Goeje (1836-1909) was 
the earliest orientalist who, on the basis of the anti-Isma'ili Muslim 
sources available in nineteenth-century Europe, arrived at the conclu- 
sion that very close relations had existed between them. Subsequently, 
similar views were expressed by other scholars. More recent scholar- 
ship, however, based on a much better understanding of early 
Isma'ilism, Fatimid Isma'ilism and Qarmatism, does not lend support 
to such views. It has now become clear that essential differences existed 
between the beliefs of the Qarmatis and the Fatimid Isma'ilis, 
differences that dated back at least to the schism of 899. The Qarmatis 
of Bahrayn and elsewhere, who continued to await the emergence of 
their hidden Mahdi, never acknowledged the Fatimids as their imams 
or caliphs, nor did they ever recognize their expected Mahdi in any of 
the Fatimids. This is why the Qarmatis of Bahrayn were so readily 
drawn into the catastrophic episode of the Persian Mahdi. But, as the 
Qarmatis and the Fatimids shared a common hostility towards the 
Abbasids, it may have appeared that at times they acted according to a 
joint strategy. 
However, Sunni Muslim authors of the Fatimid and later times, who 
were bent on discrediting the entire Ismacili movement and who were 
generally ill-informed about the internal divisions of Shi'ism and 
Isma'ilism, readily attributed the atrocities of the Qarmatis of Bahrayn 
to the machinations of the Fatimids, their alleged secret masters. 
Similarly, they found it convenient to blame the Fatimids for the anti- 
Islamic and libertine practices of the Qarmatis of Bahrayn, which 

The Isma'ilis in History and in Mediaeval Muslim Writings 23 
culminated in their desecrating acts in Mecca and the fiasco of the 
Persian Mahdi. The unfounded accusations of the Muslim authors 
contributed significantly to shaping anti-Isma'ili opinion in mediaeval 
Muslim society; they also provided source materials for many of the 
erroneous conclusions reached by later Muslim writers as well as the 
orientalists of the nineteenth century. 
Indeed, the establishment of the Fatimid caliphate, marking the peak 
of the Isma'ili challenge to Sunni Islam, called forth a systematic and 
often organized anti-Ismacili intellectual reaction on the part of the 
Sunni majority, while the hostilities of the Twelver and Zaydi Shi'is 
had become further accentuated by the new success of the Isma'ili 
Shi'is. As a result, the Isma'ilis now began to be widely condemned by 
the majority of Muslim theologians, heresiographers and historians as 
malahida or mulhids (heretics or deviators in religious beliefs); and the 
Sunni polemicists in particular began to fabricate evidence that would 
lend support to that condemnation on specific doctrinal grounds. This 
general anti-Isma'ili campaign was encouraged and supported by most 
of the ruling dynasties of the mediaeval Muslim world. 
The Sunni polemicists who wrote anti-Isma'ili tracts and pamphlets 
had a particular goal in mind; they aimed to discredit the Isma'ili 
movement from its origins. Consequently, they began to produce varied 
fictitious accounts of the sinister objectives, immoral doctrines and 
libertine practices of the Isma'ilis, while utilizing every opportunity 
to refute the Alid descent of the Isma'ili imams. By spreading 
these accounts, the polemicists gradually created a 'black legend' of 
Isma'ilism, which was cleverly portrayed as the arch-heresy (ilhad) in 
Islam, carefully designed by some non-Alid imposters, or even Jewish 
magicians disguised as Muslims, to destroy Islam from within. Soon, 
these polemical writings came to be accepted as accurate descriptions of 
Isma'ili motives, beliefs and practices, leading to further anti-Isma'ili 
polemics and mobilizing the opinion of the Muslim society at large 
against the Isma'ilis. 
Numerous Sunni polemicists, as well as Muslim authors of other 
genres of writings, contributed to the slanderous literary campaign. In 
particular, the Abbasids, whose legitimacy had been directly challenged 
rather successfully by the Fatimids, encouraged and commissioned the 
systematic composition of polemical treatises against the Isma'iliyya, 
or the malahida as they were now commonly called. The Isma'ilis were 
designated sometimes also as the Batiniyya, referring essentially to the 
Isma'ili distinction in the doctrinal domain between the apparent or 
exoteric (zahir) and the hidden or esoteric (batin) meanings of the 
religious scriptures and commandments. This appellation was often 

taken to imply antinomianism and irreligiosity, because it could easily 
be misinterpreted to mean that the Isma'ilis laid excessive or even 
exclusive emphasis on the significance of the batin at the expense of the 
zahir, or the letter of the law and the religious duties as specified by the 
Quran and the sacred law of Islam (shari'a). 
As a part of the same official anti-Isma'ili campaign, the Abbasid 
caliph al-Qadir (991-1031) assembled a number of Sunni and Twelver 
Shi'i scholars at his court in Baghdad and commanded them to declare 
in a written statement that the contemporary Fatimid caliph al-Hakim 
and his predecessors lacked genuine Fatimid Alid ancestry. This 
manifesto, issued in 1011, was read in mosques throughout the 
Abbasid dominions. In addition, al-Qadir commissioned several theo- 
logians to write treatises condemning the Isma'ilis and their doctrines. 
Starting in 1017, the dissident Druze movement, which propagated the 
divinity of al-Hakim along with other extremist ideas, split off from 
Isma'ilism. This movement provided further grounds for confusion and 
anti-Isma'ili defamation, even though the headquarters of the Fatimid 
ddwa organization at Cairo had officially rejected Druze teachings and 
the Druzes themselves were suppressed in Fatimid Egypt. In 1052, the 
Abbasid caliph al-Qa'im (1031-75) sponsored yet another anti- 
Fatimid manifesto at Baghdad, which again aimed at discrediting the 
Alid genealogy of the Fatimid dynasty. 
Nevertheless, the Fatimid Isma'ili ddwa continued to be preached 
secretly in the Abbasid lands; and its success was briefly crowned in the 
East during 1058-9 when, due to the pro-Fatimid activities of the 
Turkish general al-Basasiri in Iraq, Fatimid suzerainty was briefly 
acknowledged in Baghdad itself, where the Abbasid al-Qa'im was now 
temporarily held captive. As Isma'ilism continued to spread success- 
fully in Iraq and Persia during the long reign of the Fatimid caliph- 
imam al-Mustansir (1036-94), the Isma'ilis found a formidable enemy 
in the Saljuq Turks, the new overlords of the Abbasids who, as the 
zealous champions of Sunni Islam, intended to rid the Muslim world of 
the Isma'ilis and the Fatimids. Nizam al-Mulk, the learned vizier of the 
early Saljuqs and the virtual ruler of the Saljuq dominions for more 
than two decades, devoted a long section in his Siyasat-nama to the 
denunciation of the Isma'ilis whose object, according to him, was 'to 
abolish Islam, to mislead mankind and cast them into perdition'.'s 
Nizam al-Mulk was certainly echoing an official anti-Isma'ili attitude 
when he categorically declared that 
never has there been a more sinister, more perverted or more 
iniquitous crowd than these people, who behind walls are plotting 

The Isma'ilis in History and in Mediaeval Muslim Writings 25 
harm to this country and seeking to destroy the religion . . . and as 
far as they can they will leave nothing undone in the pursuit of 
vice, mischief, murder and heresy.16 
Meanwhile, the Abbasids themselves had continued to encourage the 
writing of polemical works against the Isma'ilis. The most famous of 
such works was written by Abu Hamid Muhammad al-Ghazali 
(d. 11 1 I), the celebrated Sunni theologian, jurist, philosopher and 
mystic. Al-Ghazali was appointed in 1091 by Nizam al-Mulk to a 
teaching position at the famous Nizamiyya Madrasa in Baghdad, where 
he was commissioned by the Abbasid caliph al-Mustazhir (1094-1118) 
to write a treatise in refutation of the Batinis (IsmaTlis). This work, 
which became commonly known as al-Mustazhiri, was written shortly 
before al-Ghazali left Baghdad in 1095. Subsequently, al-Ghazali 
produced several shorter works against the Ismaeilis and the legitimacy 
of their imam while upholding the rights of the Abbasid caliph to the 
leadership of the Muslim community. 
It was, however, the treatise of a Sunni polemicist which had the 
greatest and the most enduring impaa on the anti-lsma'ili writings of 
mediaeval Muslim authors. This major protagonist of the anti-Ismacili 
'black legend' was a certain Abu Abd Allah Muhammad b. Rizam al- 
Ta'i al-Kufi, who flourished in the first half of the tenth century and 
headed the mazalim court for the investigation of public grievances in 
Baghdad. Ibn Rizam wrote an elaborate treatise in refutation of 
IsmaClism shortly after the foundation of the Fatimid caliphate. This 
treatise, which has not been recovered, was utilized extensively in 
another anti-Isma'ili book written around 980 by an Alid genealogist 
and polemicist who lived in Damascus; Abu'l-Husayn Muhammad 
b. Ali, better known by his nickname of Akhu Muhsin or 'Brother of 
Muhsin'. Akhu Muhsin's book, too, which contained separate histori- 
cal and doctrinal parts, has been lost, though substantial portions of it 
have been preserved by some later Muslim historians, notably al- 
Nuwayri, Ibn al-Dawadari and al-Maqrizi. 
The Ibn Rizam-Akhu Muhsin account, which acquired wide popu- 
larity, basically portrayed Ismacilism as a secret conspiracy for the 
abolition of Islam founded by a non-Alid (Abd Allah b. Maymun al- 
Qaddah) who was also depicted as the progenitor of the Fatimid 
caliphs. According to this account, Maymun al-Qaddah was a 
Bardesanian who became a follower of Abu'l-Khattab and founded a 
sea called Maymuniyya. His son Abd Allah, who desired to destroy 
Islam from within, founded the Isma'ili movement with its seven (or 
nine) grades of initiation culminating in unbelief and atheism. But in 

order to hide his sinister intentions, Abd Allah pretended to be a ShiT 
working on behalf of Muhammad b. Isma'il as the expected Mahdi. 
Eventually, one of Abd Allah's Qaddahid successors went to North 
Africa and founded the Fatimid dynasty, claiming to be a descendant of 
Muhammad b. Isma'il. 
Modem scholarship, in clarifying the true biographies of Maymun 
al-Qaddah and his son Abd Allah, who were loyal companions of the 
imams al-Baqir and al-Sadiq and lived long before the appearance of 
the Isma'ili movement, has finally dispelled this most derogatory aspect 
of the Ibn Rizam-Akhu Muhsin account, designated by W. Ivanow as 
the myth of Ibn al-Qaddah. At the same time, progress in the study of 
early Isma'ilism has provided some plausible explanations for the basis 
of this myth which was originally put into circulation by Ibn Rizam, 
probably under the influence of anti-Isma'ili ideas propagated by the 
early Qarmatis." But the majority of later Muslim authors treated this 
myth as reality and contributed their own interpolations to the 
catalogue of Ibn al-Qaddah's intellectual ancestry and heresies.'* 
The Ibnizam-khu'Muhsin account was utilized by numerous 
famous heresiographers, such as al-Baghdadi (d. 1037) who included 
one of the most hostile descriptions of the Isma'ilis in his al-Farq bayn 
al-firaq. Al-Baghdadi excludes the Isma'ilis (Batinis) from the Islamic 
communitysand categorically states that 
the damage caused by the Batiniyya to the Muslim seas is greater 
than the damage caused them by the Jews, Christians and 
Magians; nay, graver than the injury inflicted on them by the 
Materialists and other non-believing sects; nay, graver than 
the injury resulting to them from the Antichrist who will appear at 
the end of time.I9 
The same account influenced the anti-Fatimid manifesto of Baghdad, 
issued in 1011, as well as Nizam al-Mulk's section on the Isma'ilis in 
his Siyasat-nama. It was also drawn upon in the polemics of the Zaydis, 
including the theological views of al-Haruni al-Husayni (d. 1020), an 
imam of the Caspian Zaydis who refuted the claims of the Fatimid al- 
Hakim to the imamate and acknowledged Ibn al-Qaddah as the 
progenitor of the Fatimids. Al-Kirmani, the most learned Fatimid ddi 
of al-Hakim's time and one of the greatest Isma'ili philosophers who 
also developed a new Isma'ili Neoplatonic cosmology, wrote a special 
treatise in response to such Zaydi attacks;20 it was the same al-Kirmani 
who was called to Cairo to produce several works in refutation of 
Druze ideas during the early years of that movement. 
The defamatory inventions of Ibn Rizam aRd Akhu Muhsin also 

The Isma'ilis in History and in Mediaeval Muslim Writings 27 
provided ample material for a number of maliciously travestied 
accounts of Isma'ili teachings and practices, which for centuries 
circulated as genuine Isma'ili texts and proved extremely effective in 
further portraying the Isma'ilis as a community of 'heretics' to other 
Muslims?' 
In sum, the 'black legend' invented by the chief anti-Isma'ili 
polemicists of the tenth century came to be accepted as an accurate 
description by successive generations of the mediaeval Muslim writers 
and by Muslim society at large; Muslims were now prepared to apply 
any term of abuse to the Isrna'ilis, even before Nizari Isma'ilis 
themselves became targets for particular defamations. It was within 
such a hostile milieu that the Europeans of the Crusader and later times 
began their superficial investigation of the Nizari Isma'ilis, adding their 
own legends to the catalogue of heresies and absurd practices attributed 
to the Isma'ilis. In time, the& hostile and fanciful eastern and western 
sources provided the basis of the Isma'ili studies of the orientalists of 
the nineteenth century. 
In a sense, the Isma'ilis almost seem to have been destined to be 
misrepresented and misjudged. This is rather ironic in view of the 
extensive literature they themselves produced throughout their history, 
especially during the Fatimid period.22 Indeed, while Ibn Rizam, Akhu 
Muhsin, al-Baghdadi and many other anti-Isma'ili writers were busy 
inventing their elaborate and imaginative myths, a vast volume of 
literature was being produced in Persia and elsewhere by celebrated 
Isma'ili theologians and philosophers such as alSijistani, al-Kirmani 
and Nasir-i Khusraw, who were at the same time functioning as. 
capable ddis spreading the cause of the Fatimid caliph-imams and 
their religio-political da'wa. Meanwhile, starting with the work of the 
Qadi al-Nu'man (d. 974), the foremost Fatimid jurist, the Isma'ili 
Shi'i system of law was elaborated under the Fatimids, who placed 
equal emphasis on the literal meaning as well as the hidden significance 
and inner spirituality of the Quran and the religious commandments of 
Islam. 
As a rare instance of its kind in the history of Isma'ilism, the Isma'ili 
imams, who ruled over the Fatimid state and desired the events of their 
dynasty and dawla to be recorded by trustworthy chroniclers, also 
concerned themselves with historical writings. They commissioned or 
encouraged the compilation of chronicles of the Fatimid dynasty and 
histories of the Fatimid state, especially after transferring the seat of 
their caliphate to Egypt in 973. Many chroniclers contributed to this 
temporary tradition of Isma'ili historiography.u These Fatimid chron- 
icles, a few of which have survived in fragmentary form or in 

quotations by later historians, were readily available to all con- 
temporary Muslim authors living within and outside the Fatimid 
dominions. 
With the fall of the Fatimid dynasty in 1171, however, their 
renowned libraries were effectively destroyed, while the Isma'ilis and 
their religious literature were severely suppressed in Egypt during the 
subsequent Ayyubid and Mamluk periods. But a few decades earlier, a 
good portion of the Isma'ili literature of the Fatimid period found its 
way to Yaman, from where it was subsequently transmitted to India. 
This explains why many Fatimid Isma'ili texts of a philosophical or 
theological nature remain extant while the Fatimid chronicles, compiled 
at different times, have not survived. 
There have also always been available valuable archival documents 
for the Fatimid state, as well as various non-literary sources of 
information on the Fatimids. Nevertheless, historians, like other 
Muslim writers of mediaeval times, preferred to retain their own hostile 
approaches rooted mainly in the misconceptions and defamations of 
anti-Isma'ili polemics. 
The Isma'ili movement was rent by a major schism in 1094, which 
had drastic consequences for its future. During the long reign of the 
Fatimid caliph-imam al-Mustansir (1036-94), the caliphate had already 
b en  
its general decline, especially after the 1050s. The dispute over 
al-Mustansir's succession in 1094 split the Isma'ili movement itself into 
two rival branches, the Nizaris and the Mustalians. 
Al-Mustansir had designated his eldest son Abu Mansur Nizar as his 
successor. However, al-Afdal, who a ,few months before al-Mustansir's 
death had succeeded his own father, Badr al-Jamali, as the all-powerful 
vizier and military dictator of the Fatimid state, had different plans. 
Aiming to retain the reins of the state, al-Afdal favoured the succession 
of al-Mustansir's youngest son Abu'l-Qasim Ahmad, who would be 
entirely dependent upon him. At the time, the youthful Ahmad was 
married to al-Afdal's sister. At any rate, in what amounted to a palace 
coup d'Ctat, al-Afdal placed Ahmad on the Fatimid throne with the title 
of al-Musta'li billah, speedily obtaining the endorsement of this act 
from the notables of the Fatimid state and the leaders of the Isma'ili 
da'wa organization in Cairo. 
The dispossessed Nizar, whose succession rights were never revoked 
by his father, hurriedly fled to Alexandria, where he received strong 
local support and rose in revolt. After some initial success, however, his 
revolt was crushed in 1095. Nizar himself was captured and taken to 
Cairo where he was executed on al-Musta'li's orders. As a result of 
these developments, the unified Isma'ili movement of the latter decades 

The Isma'ilis in History and in Mediaeval Muslim Writings 29 
of al-Mustansir's rule was now split into two rival factions, which were 
to remain bitter enemies. The imamate of al-Mustali, who had been 
firmly installed to the Fatimid caliphate, was recognized by the bulk of 
the Isma'ilis in Egypt, by many in Syria, and by the whole Isma'ili 
community in Yaman and its subsidiary Indian community in Gujarat. 
These Isma'ilis, known as the Musta'liyya, maintained their relations 
with the central headquarters of the ddwa in Cairo. On the other 
hand, almost all the IsmaCli communities of the Muslim East, headed 
by the Persian Isma'ilis who were already under the leadership of 
Hasan Sabbah, as well as a large number in Syria, upheld Nizar's 
succession rights, recognizing him as their nineteenth imam in succes- 
sion to his father. These Isma'ilis, known as the Nizariyya, perma- 
nently severed their relations with the Fatimids and Cairo, which had 
now become the seat of the Musta'lian ddwa. 
Al-Musta'li remained a puppet in the hands of al-Afdal throughout 
his short reign (1094-1 101), during which the Crusaders first appeared 
(in 1097) in the Levant to liberate the Holy Land of Christendom. The 
Crusaders easily defeated a local Fatimid garrison and then seized their 
main target, Jerusalem, in 1099. By 1100, the Crusaders had firmly 
established themselves in Palestine, and had founded several principal- 
ities based on Jerusalem and other localities in Palestine and Syria. In 
the midst of the Fatimids' continued attempts to repel the Crusaders, 
al-Mustacli died in 1101. Al-Afdal now proclaimed al-Musta'li's five- 
year-old son as the new Fatimid caliph with the title of al-Arnir bi- 
Ahkam Allah, and himself retained the reins of the state for another 20 
years until his assassination in 1121. 
During the reign of al-Amir, when the Nizaris were successfully 
consolidating their power in Persia and Syria, an assembly was 
convened in 1122 in the Fatimid palace in Cairo to publicize the rights 
of al-Musta'li and al-Amir to the Isma'ili imamate and to refute the 
competing claims of Nizar and his descendants. The proceedings of this 
assembly were subsequently committed to writing in the form of an 
epistle which has survived under the title of al-Hidaya al-Amiriyya, or 
the 'Guidance according to al-Amir'. This episrle, which was read from 
pulpits throughout Fatimid Egypt, represents the earliest official 
Musta'lian refutation of the Nizari claims to the imamate.24 The 
Hidaya was also sent to Syria, where it caused uproar among the 
Nizaris of Damascus. One of the Syrian Nizaris forwarded al-Amir's 
epistle to his chief, who wrote a refutation of it. Smn afterwards, al- 
Amir issued an additional epistle, refuting the Nizari refutation of al- 
hi day^.^' The IsmaTlis were now embarked on their own internal 
polemics, to the joy of the rest of Muslim society. It is interesting to 

note that in al-Amir's second anti-Nizari epistle, issued early in 1123 
and sent to Syria, the Nizari Isma'ilis were for the fitst time designated 
as the 'Hashishiyya', without any explanation?6 
With the assassination of al-Amir in 1130, at the hands of a group of 
Nizari fida'is or d e v o t,  the internal situation of Fatimid Egypt 
deteriorated rapidly, and soon afterwards the Musta'lian Ismacilis 
themselves were rent by an important schism, which split their 
community into Hafizi and Tayyibi factions. Al-Arnir's successor al- 
Ha& (1130-49) and the later Fatimid caliphs were acknowledged as 
imams by the official da'wa organization in Cairo and by the majority 
of the Mustalian Ismacilis of Egypt and Syria, as well as by some of 
the Mustalians of Yaman. However, Hafizi Isma'ilism did not survive 
long after the collapse of the Fatimid dynasty. 
During the final decade of Fatimid rule, Egypt was invaded several 
times by Crusader armies under the command of King Amalric I of 
Jerusalem, while Nut al-Din, the Sunni Zangid ruler of Aleppo, 
pursued plans of his own for annexing Egypt to his dominions and 
uprooting the Shi'i Fatimids. Eventually, Nnr al-Din gained the upper 
hand in Egypt; in 1169, Shirkuh entered Cairo at the head of the third 
Zangid expedition dispatched from Syria and appointed himself vizier 
of the last Fatimid caliph al-Adid. When Shirkuh died suddenly shortly 
afterwards, his nephew Salah al-Din Yusuf b. Ayyub, or Saladin of the 
European sources, succeeded to that post. 
Saladin, the last Fatimid vizier and the founder of the Ayyubid 
dynasty, put an end to Fatimid rule in September 1171 when he 
deposed al-Adid and proclaimed the s.uzerainty of the Abbasids. In the 
immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Fatimid dynasty, the 
Isma'ilis of Egypt, belonging mainly to the Hahi branch, were 
persecuted severely and the claimants to the Hafizi imamate along with 
other surviving members of the Fatimid family were detained in 
captivity. By the time the Fatimid prisoners were finally released a 
century later in 1272, Isma'ilism had disappeared almost completely 
from Egypt. 
Tayyibi Ismacilism fared better, however, and Tayyibis have survived 
to the present time as the sole representatives of the Mustaclian branch 
of IsmaTlism. With the establishment of an independent Tayyibi da'wa 
in Yaman, headed by an absolute da'i, or ddi mutlaq, soon after al- 
Amir's death, Yaman remained for several centuries the chief snong- 
hold of the Tayyibi Isma'ilis, whose imams have remained hidden and 
inaccessible since the disappearance of al-Amir's infant son, al-Tayyib, 
in 1130. In time, the Tayyibi da'wa succeeded in winning numerous 
converts from among the members of a trading community in western 

The Isma'ilis in History and in Mediaeval Muslim Writings 31 
India, where the Tayyibi converts became locally designated as Bohras. 
In 1591, the Tayyibi community, then represented mainly by the 
Bohras of Gujarat, was split into two factions, the Da'udis and the 
Sulaymanis, who henceforth followed different lines of da'is. The 
Indian Tayyibis, belonging mainly to the Da'udi branch, have 
experienced a few minor schisms in the course of their history. By 
contrast, the minority Sulaymani community, centred in Yaman, has 
maintained its unity. 
In the meantime, the Nizaris, now representing the politically active 
branch of Isma'ilism, were successfully extending their movement in 
the East, throughout the Saljuq lands. As noted, by the final decades of 
al-Mustansir's imamate, the Isma'ibs of Persia and other parts of the 
Muslim East had largely rallied to the side of the Fatimid da'wa, while 
the ardently Sunni Saljuqids had replaced various local dynasties in 
those regions. At least by the early 1070s, the Isma'ilis of Persia owned 
the authority of a chief local da'i, Ibn Attash, who had his 
headquarters at Isfahan in central Persia. Ibn Attash was also 
responsible for launching the career of Hasan Sabbah, the first leader of 
the Nizari Isma'ilis. 
Hasan Sabbah, born into a Twelver Shi'i family in Qumm, in central 
Persia, converted to Isma'ilism in his youth, and by 1072 he had been 
appointed to a post in Rayy in the service of the Isma'ili dacwa. Later, 
in 1076, he set off for Egypt, where he spent three years furthering his 
training. Returning to Isfahan in 1081, Hasan spent the next nine years 
travelling to different localities in Persia as a secret Isma'ili da'i. He 
was now, in fact, reinvigorating the Isma'ili cause in Persia while 
planning to launch an open revolt there against the alien rule of the 
Saljuq Turks; an objective that also reflected the general Persian 
sentiments of the time. At any rate, in his travels Hasan carefully 
searched for a suitable site which could be utilized as the headquarters 
of his revolutionary movement, while simultsneously assessing the 
political and military power of the Saljuqs in different localities. 
Eventually Hasan's attention came to be concentrated on the Caspian 
provinces in northern Persia, the mediaeval region of Daylam, which 
had traditionally been a safe haven for the AIids and a stronghold of 
Zaydi Shi'ism. There he selected the castle of Alamut, situated on a 
high rock in the central Alburz mountains, to the north-east of the city 
of Qazwin; and it did not take him long to gain possession of that 
mountain fortress. The seizure of Alamut in 1090 by Hasan Sabbah 
initiated the open anti-Saljuq activities of the Persian Isma'ilis, also 
marking the effective foundation of what was to become the Nizari 
Isma'ili state.27 

Once established at Alamut, which was to remain the central 
headquarters of the Nizari movement until its surrender to the Mongols 
in 1256, Hasan Sabbah systematically renovated the old fortress, 
making it truly impregnable. He also improved and extended the 
systems of irrigation and cultivation in the Alamut valley, where he dug 
water canals and planted numerous trees. It was in this same locality 
that, according to the legendary account of Marco Polo, a secret 
'garden of paradise' had been built by the leader of thesrna'ilis.Hasan seized or constructed many other mountain strongholds in 
northern Persia and in a few other regions, notably in southern 
Khurasan, known then as Kuhistan (Arabicized, Quhistan), where the 
Isma'ilis came to control a number of towns as well. By 1092, Hasan 
Sabbah's activities had already attracted so much attention that the 
Saljuq sultan Malikshah (1072-92) decided, probably on the advice of 
his vizier Nizam al-Mulk, to send armies against the Isma'ilis of 
northern Persia and Khurasan, initiating the first of numerous military 
encounters between the Persian Isma'ilis and the Saljuqs. 
As Hasan Sabbah was consolidating his position in Persia, Ismaeilism 
came to be confronted with its greatest internal conflict, the Nizari- 
Musta'li schism. As noted, Hasan Sabbah acknowledged the rights of 
Nizar to the imamate, and his decision was endorsed without any 
dissent by the entire Isma'ili community of Persia and also by the 
Isma'ilis of Iraq and by many Syrian Isma'ilis who, like their Persian 
co-religionists, were then under Saljuq rule. 
Soon afterwards, from the beginning of the twelfth century, Hasan 
Sabbah began to dispatch &is to Syria to organize and lead the 
Nizaris there. The political and religious fragmentation of Syria at the 
time as well as the religious traditions of the region, where almost all 
types of Shi'i and Sunni communities had existed, also favoured the 
spread of the Nizari da'wa. The appearance of the Crusaders in the 
Levant, which accentuated the local rivalries in Syria, and the rapid 
collapse of Fatimid rule under al-Mustansir's successors, further 
contributed to the eventual success there of thei z a r i s .From early on, the Persian emissaries who were dispatched from 
Alamut for organizing and leading the Syrian Nizaris used the same 
methods of struggle as devised by Hasan Sabbah for the Persian 
community. Accordingly, they attempted to seize strategic strongholds 
for use as bases of military operations, and resorted to political 
assassination, in addition to allying themselves with various local rulers 
when such temporary alliances seemed expedient. However, the Nizaris 
found their task in Syria much more difficult than it had been in Persia. 
In fact, the Nizaris had to struggle for almost half a century, first from 

The Isma'ilis in History and in Mediaeval Muslim Writings 33 
Aleppo and then from Damascus, before they finally succeeded during a 
third phase of their operations (1130-51) in acquiring a number of 
fortresses in a mountainous area of central Syria known as the Jabal 
Bahra. These fortresses, including Qadmus, Kahf and Masyaf, which 
often served as the headquarters of the chief Nizari leader in Syria, 
became collectively designated as the qila al-da'wa, 'fortresses of the 
da'a'.O 
Meanwhile, in the absence of the Nizari imams, who remained 
hidden from their followers for several decades after Nizar's death in 
1095, Hasan Sabbah, and then his next two successors at Alamut, were 
acknowledged as the supreme central leaders of the Nizari community 
and ddwa; they were the hujjas or chief representatives of the absent 
imams (similarly, the central leaders of the early Isma'ili movement 
had originally acted as the hujjas of the hidden Mahdi, Muhammad 
b. Isma'il). The early Nizari Isma'ilis had also retrieved, with much 
greater militancy, the revolutionary and millenarian zeal of the pre- 
Fatimid Isma'ili movement. In both cases, the Isma'ilis represented the 
politically most active wing of Shi'ism and, as such, they dedicated 
themselves to the overthrow of the leading established dynasties of the 
time, notably the Abbasids and their later overlords, the Saljuqids. 
Hasan Sabbah had now founded an independent religio-political 
Isma'ili mission, designated as the 'new preaching' (al-ddwa al-jadida) 
by outsiders. From early on, the revolutionary ardour and psychologi- 
cal self-assessment of the Nizari Ismacilis also found expression in the 
doctrinal domain. Hasan Sabbah reiterated the permanent need of 
mankind for a divinely guided and authoritative teacher, which had 
constituted the central belief of the Shi'a at least from the time of the 
imam Ja'far alSadiq. In a series of propositions, Hasan reformulated 
this old ShiT doctrine of ta'lim, and concluded that only the Isma'ili 
imam was such an authoritative teacher and the sole legitimate leader 
of mankind; this doctrine also served to refute, in a new theological and 
philosophical manner, the similar claims of the Abbasid caliph of 
Baghdad as well as those of the non-Isma'ili Shi'i imams. It was due to 
the centrality of this doctrine in early Nizari thought that the Nizari 
Isma'ilis now became generally designated also as the Talimiyya. 
In the political field, as noted, Hasan Sabbah initiated a policy of 
armed revolt against the Saljuqs, who were backed by the Sunni 
establishment under the titular leadership of the Abbasid caliph. The 
Nizari revolt and methods of struggle had their distinctive features and 
patterns, which were dictated by the vastly superior military power of 
the Saljuqs and the decentralized nature of their power. Under such 
conditions, the Nizari revolt came to be conducted from a multiplicity 

of mountain strongholds, each stronghold at once serving as a 
defensible abode or refuge (dar al-bijra) for the Nizaris and as 
headquarters for the local operations of their armed groups. At the 
same time, the local activities of all such Ismaeili groups were well 
coordinated by the central leadership of the movement at Alamut. The 
decentralized pattern of Saljuq power suggested to Hasan Sabbah an 
important auxiliary technique for achieving military and political aims, 
that of assassination. It was in connection with the self-sacrificing 
behaviour of the Nizari fida'is, who killed prominent opponents of 
their community in particular localities, that the main myths of the 
Nizaris, the Assassin legends, were developed during the Middle Ages. 
The Nizaris of the Alamut period were not the inventors of the policy 
of assassinating religio-political adversaries in Muslim society; nor were 
they the last group to resort to such a policy; but they did assign a 
major political role to the policy of assassination, which they utilized 
rather openly in a spectacular and intimidating fashion. As a result, 
almost any assassination of any religious, political or military signifi- 
cance during the Alamut period was attributed to them. This provided 
a most convenient pretext for other individuals or groups to remove 
their own enemies, resting assured that the Nizaris would be blamed. 
The Nizari assassinations were carried out by their fida'is, also called 
fidawis, the young self-sacrificing devotees who offered themselves for 
such suicidal missions. The assassinations of famous military or civilian 
personalities, who were normally surrounded by guards, were more 
often than not carried out in mosques and other public places, since 
part of this policy was to intimidate other enemies. Few details are 
known about the selection and training of the Nizari fida'is, who were 
glorified by their co-religionists as heroes for their bravery and 
deotion.' 
Rolls of honour of their names and assassination missions 
were compiled and retained at Alamut and other Nizari fortresses. It is 
doubtful whether the fida'is formed a special corps in Persia, while in 
Syria the Nizari fida'is were organized, at least for a time, into a special 
corps. The fida'is do not seem to have received any training in 
languages and other subjects, as suggested by the elaborate accounts of 
some occidental chroniclers of the Crusaders and later European 
writers. But at some point during the Alamut period, the practice 
evidently arose of sending some would-be assassins, under different 
guises, into the households of a number of the more notorious enemies 
of the sect. Such undercover agents were placed in an ideal position of 
readiness for possible assassination missions, and rumours about their 
existence would prove rather intimidating. 
As we shall see, designations such as hdishiyya, hashisbiyyin, or 

The Isma'ilis in History and in Mediaeval Muslim Writings 35 
hashishin (singular, hashishi), meaning supposedly hashish users, which 
were originally applied as terms of abuse to the Nizari Isma'ilis by their 
Muslim opponents, in time found particular application to the Nizari 
fida'is whose conduct seemed extraordinary to Westerners. However, 
despite the existence of such terms of abuse and the related mediaeval 
legends fabricated by uninformed observers and writers, there is no 
evidence suggesting that hashish or any other narcotic product was ever 
administered to motivate the fida'is or condition them to perform their 
dangerous tasks. On the contrary, the fida'is, who displayed an 
intensive group sentiment and sense of devotion in both Persia and 
Syria, were highly alert and sober individuals who often had to wait 
patiently and for extended periods in order to find a suitable 
opportunity to accomplish their missions. Indeed, the available evi- 
dence indicates that the Nizari fida'is were young devotees who 
personally volunteered to sacrifice their lives, as a matter of conviction, 
in the service of their religion and community. 
The armed revolt of the Nizaris, with the spectacular assassinations 
attributed to them, posed a mounting threat to the Sunni establishment 
and speedily qualified the Nizaris as a new Isma'ili target for 
persecution and refutation by the Muslim majority. The vizier Nizam 
al-Mulk, who was assassinated in 1092, possibly by a Nizari fida'i:2 
had already alarmed his Saljuqid master of the imminent danger of the 
rising power of the Persian Isma'ilis. At any rate, by condemning the 
Isma'ilis in the strongest possible terms in his Siyasat-nama (The Book 
of Government), Nizam al-Mulk had in fact signalled the beginning of 
a new era in the persecution of the Isma'ilis and the literary campaign 
against them within Muslim society. From the earliest years of the 
Nizari state, the Saljuqs sent military expeditions against their 
territories in northern Persia and in Khurasan. Despite their over- 
whelming military power, however, the Saljuqs failed to defeat the 
Nizaris on the battlefield, mainly due to the astonishing solidarity of the 
Nizaris and the impregnability of their scattered mountain strongholds. 
As a result, the Saljuqs and their Sunni judges adopted an auxiliary 
policy of their own: large-scale massacres of the Nizari Isma'ilis. It 
became an established practice in many urban localities to round up all 
those accused of being Isma'ili and to consign them to fire or put them 
to the sword, especially in the aftermath of a Nizari-suspected 
assassination. Large numbers of Nizaris were thus massacred, and their 
properties confiscated, in great cities like Aleppo, Damascus, Qazwin 
and Isfahan, the main Saljuq capital in Persia, as well as in the towns of 
southern Khurasan and elsewhere. New records were eventually set in 
such massacres by the Mongols, who practically exterminated the 

entire Persian Nizari community. Meanwhile, the Nizaris had con- 
tinued to consolidate their position and expand their network of 
strongholds under Hasan Sabbah (d. 1124) and his next two succes- 
sors, Kiya Buzurg-Ummid (1124-38) and Muhammad b. Buzurg- 
Ummid (1138-62). 
The Muslim opponents of the Nizaris, whose hostility towards the 
Isma'ilis in general had now been rekindled at a higher level, were 
much more successful in their anti-Nizari literary campaign. This vast 
and semi-official campaign, involving polemicists, heresiographers, 
theologians, jurists and historians, which was rooted in the earlier anti- 
Isma'ili 'black legend', went a long way towards shaping the anti- 
Nizari opinion of mediaeval Muslims. It succeeded in making the 
Nizaris perhaps the most feared community in the mediaeval Islamic 
world. 
The Abbasids now began, as they had done in the case of the 
Fatimids, to sponsor polemical treatises in refutation of the Nizari 
Isma'ilis and their doctrines. Highly imaginative accounts of Nizari 
heresies and libertine practices began to pour forth, essentially 
depicting the sectarians as a group of immoral assassins who were 
capable of any sort of crime or mischievous act desired by their cunning 
leaders. In this category, the earliest and one of the most widely 
circulated anti-Isma'ili books, was al-Ghazali's al-Mustazhiri which 
was in fact mainly directed against the Nizaris and their doctrine of 
taclim, or authoritative teaching in religion. Al-Ghazali concocted his 
own elaborate 'Nizari system' of graded teaching and indoctrination, 
which would allow for any conceivable heresy before leading the 
initiate to an ultimate stage of unbelief and atheism.33 Al-Ghazali's 
anti-Isma'ili defamations were adopted and reformulated during the 
Alamut period by other Sunni writers, all of whom were also 
acquainted to various degrees with the myths fabricated by Ibn Rizam 
and Akhu Muhsin. 
The Shi'is indulged in their own anti-Nizari polemics. The Imami or 
Twelver Shi'i writers, constituting a quiescent minority in the predomi- 
nantly Sunni Persia until the sixteenth century, produced several 
treatises in refutation of the Nizaris and their competing claims to the 
Shi'i imamate; while the Imami scholars living during the Alamut 
period generally denounced the Nizaris as malahida par excellence. For 
instance, Abd al-Jalil Qazwini Razi, a renowned Imami scholar of the 
twelfth century, wrote a major treatise in refutation of the Nizaris 
which is lost. He also attacks the Nizaris extensively throughout his 
only extant work, Kitab al-naqd, which is a detailed refutation of a 
polemical work written against Imami ShiTsm by a former member of 

The Isma'ilis in History and in Mediaeval Muslim Writings 37 
that community. Reiterating many of the anti-Ismacili stances of Ibn 
Rizam and Akhu Muhsin, Abd al-Jalil concluded that the Isma'ilis 
were worse than  unbeliever^.^^ This damaging verdict was repeated in 
many other anti-Nizari polemics of the period. 
The Zaydi Shi'is, who were the dosest rivals of the Nizaris in 
northern Persia and had prolonged military confrontations with them 
in the Caspian region, launched their own anti-Nizari literary 
campaign. It has recently come to light that the Caspian Zaydis, too, 
referred to the Persian Nizaris as 'Hashishis' in some of their early 
thirteenth-century writings.3s 
These generally hostile attitudes found expression to various degrees 
also in the works of Muslim historians. For the history of the Persian 
Nizaris of the Alamut period, the chief authorities are three Persian 
historians of the Ilkhanid period (1256-1353), namely Juwayni, Rashid 
al-Din Fad1 Allah and Kashani, who had direct access to certain 
contemporary Nizari chronicles and other sources which are no longer 
extant. Of these three, Juwayni, who had accompanied his master 
Hulagu in his campaigns against Alamut and other Persian Nizari 
strongholds in 1256, was particularly hostile towards the Nizaris, 
doubtless desiring to please Hulagu who had aimed to extirpate the 
Nizari community. The Persian Nizaris are treated with equal vindict- 
iveness in the chronicles of the Saljuqs, their arch-enemies. It is 
interesting to note that, in one of the few surviving written instances of 
its kind, the Syrian Nizaris are referred to as 'Hashishiyya' in the 
earliest known Saljuq chronicle, the Nusrat al-fatra, written in 1183 by 
Imad al-Din Muhammad al-Katib al-Isfahani (d. 1201), a work that is 
extant only in an abridgement completed in 1226 by al-Bundari.j6 
The Syrian Nizaris of the Alamut period, too, are treated with 
contempt in numerous contemporary or later regional histories of 
Syria.37 In this category, Abu Shama (1203-67), who lived in the time 
of the Sunni Ayyubids and Mamluks, is evidently the only Syrian 
chronicler to refer to the Syrian Nizaris with the designation of 
'Hashishiyya' (singular,  h ash is hi').^^ Abu Shama was used as a main 
source by Silvestre de Sacy for his etymological explanation of the word 
assassin. Ibn Muyassar (d. 1278), who produced an extensive history of 
Fatimid Egypt during the second half of the thirteenth century under 
the early Marnluks, is one of the few other Arab historians of that 
period to use the term hasbishiyya in reference to the Syrianizaris.'The Syrian Nizaris, and to a lesser extent their Persian co-religionists, 
are also discussed with hostility in the general Arabic chronicles, 
including the celebrated Ta'rikh of Ibn al-Athir (d. 1233), representing 
the zenith of Muslim annalistic historiography. It is, therefore, not 

surprising that the Nizaris, the targets of so much animosity and abuse, 
came to be commonly designated by all sorts of derogatory terms such 
as malahida and hashishiyya. It was under such circumstances that 
imaginative tales and legends about them began to be circulated. 
The Nizaris of the Alamut period themselves made no special efforts 
to dispel their distorted image within Muslim society. Modem 
scholarship has made it abundantly clear, however, that the Nizaris 
were definitely not an 'order of assassins' bent on destroying Islam. 
Their community was, and remained, a Shi'i Muslim community led 
initially by da'is and then, after 1164, by the Nizari imams themselves. 
This highly disciplined community, scattered in different territories 
stretching from Syria to eastern Persia, managed to establish and 
maintain a cohesive state, centrally directed from Alamut, despite 
formidable odds. In the doctrinal domain, the Nizaris adhered to Shi'i 
teachings, with a central role assigned to their imam. In the imam's 
absence, his chief representatives were followed with as much devotion 
and obedience. In addition, they encouraged and patronized the 
intellectual activities of numerous non-Isma'ili scholars who had found 
refuge among them. 
Hasan Sabbah, the founder of this community and state, was at once 
a strategist, an administrator and a thinker who led a highly ascetic life 
and enforced the sacred law of Islam very strictly throughout his 
community. Possessing an unrivalled sense of purpose, he was highly 
revered by the Nizaris, who called him sayyidna, 'our lord'; and his 
grave at Alamut became a place of pilgrimage for the Nizaris until it, 
too, was destroyed by the Mongols in 1256. Hasan produced some 
doctrinal treatises in which he set down the religious guidelines of the 
Nizari Isma'ili community. However, the Nizaris, initially conducting 
an armed revolt and always extremely concerned with their survival in 
different hostile milieus, did not have time for complex theological or 
philosophical speculations. In a sense, the intellectual activities of the 
Nizaris were by and large geared to the more pressing and practical 
needs of their state and struggle; and the Nizari ddis often acted as 
military commanders of the various strongholds. As a result, the 
Nizaris never produced a voluminous religious literature.40 The few 
Nizari texts which were actually composed during that turbulent period 
do not seem to have been readily accessible to outsiders, with whom the 
sectarians rarely discussed their doctrines. Thus, the Nizaris themselves 
unwittingly encouraged the fabrication of Nizari tales and the 
unfounded accusations levelled against them. 
Like their predecessors on the Fatimid throne, the Persian lords of 

The Isma'ilis in History and in Mediaeval Muslim Writings 39 
Alamut, too, sponsored the compilation of official chronicles recording 
the detailed history of the Persian Nizari community and state. These 
chronicles, few in number and arranged in terms of the reigns of the 
successive lords of Alamut, starting with the Sargudhasht-i Sayyidna 
which covered the life and times of Hasan Sabbah, represented another 
rare and temporary tradition of Isma'ili historiography.'" The official 
Nizari chronicles and other Nizari sources and documents, including 
the decrees and epistles (fusul) of the imams, were seen and utilized 
extensively by that group of Persian historians of the Ilkhanid period 
already mentioned, namely, Juwayni (d. 1283), Rashid al-Din Fad1 
Allah (d. 1318), and Kashani (d. ca. 1337). Juwayni was an eyewirness 
to the Mongol invasions of Persia and personally participated in the 
final negotiations between Hulagu and the Nizari leadership, leading to 
the downfall of the Nizari state there. He relates how, with Hulagu's 
permission, he examined the celebrated Isma'ili library at Alamut, 
from where he selected many 'choice books', before consigning to the 
flames those treatises which, in his view, related to the heresy and error 
of the Isma'ilis. Utilizing the Nizari sources at his disposal, Juwayni 
produced an account of the Nizari state at the end of his history of the 
Mongols and their conquests, soon after the fall ofl a m u t . 4Interspersing his narrative with an arsenal of invectives and defamatory 
epithets, Juwayni missed no opportunity to express his contempt for 
the Nizaris and their leaders. 
The Isma'ili histories of Rashid al-Din, the famous Sunni historian, 
vizier and physician, and Kashani, who was a Twelver Shi'i and 
participated in the compilation of Rashid al-Din's vast universal history 
Uami al-tawarikh), are more detailed and less hostile than Juwayni's 
account.43 Both these historians quote extensively from the Nizari 
chronicles of the Alamut period, often also naming their sources. All 
the Nizari sources utilized by these historians perished in Mongol 
Persia; and, thus, their histories of the Persian Nizari state and 
community during the Alamut period remain our chief sources for the 
subject. 
The Nizari community of the Alamut period, comprised of high- 
landers and mountain dwellers, villagers, and urban groups in small 
towns, did nevertheless maintain a sophisticated outlook and literary 
tradition, also valuing intellectual and scientific activities in general. 
Hasan Sabbah himself founded a renowned library at Alamut, whose 
collections of Isma'ili and non-Isma'ili works had grown impressively 
by the time the Mongols destroyed it. In Khurasan and Syria, too, the 
Nizaris established libraries, containing not only religious and historical 
works of all sorts, but also archival documents, and scientific tracts and 

equipment. The Nizaris, thus, manifested genuine interest in different 
branches of learning and Islamic sciences, despite their long-drawn 
military entanglements with Saljuqs and other adversaries. This 
explains why many Muslim scholars, both Sunni and Twelver Shi'i, 
and even Jewish scientists, availed themselves of the Nizari libraries and 
patronage of learning. Some of these outside scholars, who played an 
active part in the intellectual life of the Nizari community, even 
converted to Isma'ilism, at least temporarily. The most prominent 
member of this special group was the celebrated philosopher, theo- 
logian and astronomer Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201-74), who was 
originally a Twelver Shi'i. He spent some three decades (1227-56) 
among the Nizaris of Khurasan and northern Persia, during which time 
he embraced Isma'ilism; and he was with the last lord of Alamut when 
the latter surrendered to the Mongols. It was during this period that al- 
Tusi produced some of his best known works, such as the Akhfaq-i 
Nasiri (The Nasirean Ethics), as well as several Isma'ili treatises, which 
remain our main sources of information on the Nizari teachings of the 
late Alamut period. On the fall of Alamut, al-Tusi entered the service of 
Hulagu, and later became a vizier to the Mongol Ilkhanids. 
The Nizaris also developed their mountain enclaves, consisting of 
fortresses with their surrounding villages, into viable socio-economic 
and military entities, utilizing highly ingenious techniques in their water 
supply and fortification systems. Surely the Nizari heritage should not 
be based solely or even chiefly on their much publicized religio-political 
assassinations and the related Assassin legends. 
In the meantime, the Nizaris had entered a period of stalemate in 
their relations with the Saljuqs; both the Nizari revolt initiated by 
Hasan Sabbah and the Saljuq offensive against them having proved 
ineffective. The Nizaris did not, however, abandon the ultimate 
objectives of their political struggle, and they managed to hold on to 
their strongholds in Persia and Syria. In the event, the Nizari 
community had now transformed itself into a permanent state, taking 
its precarious place among the small states and territorial principalities 
within the Saljuq realm. At the same time, the Nizaris had been waiting 
impatiently, since Nizar's death, for the appearance of their imam, who 
would personally take charge of their leadership and guide them in 
those troubled times. 
It was under these circumstances that the fourth ruler of Alamut, 
Hasan I1 (1162-6), whom the Nizaris designated a h  dhikrihr'l-safam 
(on his mention be peace), initiated a religious revolution in the 
community. On 8 August 1164, in a solemn ceremony held at Alamut 
in the presence of the representatives of different Nizari territories, 

The Isma'ilis in History and in Mediaeval Muslim Writings 41 
Hasan I1 proclaimed the qiyama or Resurrection which ushered a 
second phase in the life of the Nizari Isma'ilis of the Alamut period. 
The qiyama, the awaited 'last day' when mankind would be judged and 
committed for ever to either Paradise or Hell, was however interpreted 
spiritually on the basis of the well-known Isma'ili method of ta'wil 
(esoteric interpretation). Accordingly, the qiyama was essentially held 
to mean the manifestation of the unveiled truth in the person of the 
Nizari imam. Only the Nizaris were now capable of comprehending 
spiritual reality, the immutable truths hidden behind all the religious 
laws; and, as such, Paradise was made real for them in this world. By 
contrast, all others, non-Nizari Muslims as well as non-Muslims, who 
did not accord recognition to the Nizari imam, were henceforth cast 
into eternal Hell, which was in effect a state of spiritual non-existence. 
In sum, the Nizaris were now collectively introduced into Paradise on 
earth, while the rest of mankind was made non-existent and irrelevant. 
Soon, the Nizaris recognized Hasan I1 and his son and successor Nur 
al-Din Muhammad I1 (1166-1210), as their imams from the progeny of 
Nizar. Muhammad I1 devoted his long reign to the elaboration of the 
doctrine of the qiyama while the Nizaris were increasingly isolating 
themselves in their mountain strongholds from the rest of Muslim 
society. Juwayni and other Persian historians also relate that in line 
with the expectations regarding the time of Resurrection, the sacred 
law of Islam was abrogated in the Nizari community. The believers, as 
was fitting in Paradise, could henceforth dispense with the obligations 
specified by the letter of the law, since they had now found access to the 
meanings hidden behind those commandments. According to Rashid al- 
Din and Kashani, it was due to their alleged abolition of the law that 
the Nizaris qualified themselves more precisely for the term malahida. 
In Syria, the qiyama phase in Nizari history coincided with the career 
of Rashid al-Din Sinan, the most famous Nizari leader there. Sinan, 
known to the Crusaders as the 'Old Man of the Mountain', reorganized 
the Syrian Nizari community, also fortifying their strongholds. He 
adopted suitable policies and shifting alliances in dealing with the 
various regional rulers and powers, including the Crusaders and 
Saladin who was then leading the Muslim holy war against the 
Crusaders. 
Sinan established peaceful relations with the Crusaders, who had 
periodical entanglements with the Nizaris over the possession of 
various strongholds. Meanwhile, the Syrian Nizaris had acquired a 
more serious Frankish enemy in the Hospitallers, who in 1142 had 
received from the lord of Tripoli the celebrated fortress of Krak des 
Chevaliers at the southern end of the Jabal Bahra. The Nizaris 

continued to have periodic confrontations with the Knights Hospitaller 
and Knights Templar (Hospitallers and Templars), military orders 
which acted rather independently in the Latin East. In 1173, Sinan sent 
an embassy to Amalric I, evidently seeking formal rapprochement with 
the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem. As Arnalric died soon afterwards in 
1174, however, negotiations between the Franks and the Old Man of 
the Mountain proved fruitless. 
A few years earlier, in 1171, the Zangids of Aleppo had succeeded 
through Saladin in overthrowing the Fatimid dynasty. Subsequently, 
Saladin became the champion of Sunnism and Muslim unification and, 
as such, he posed a greater threat than the Crusaders to the 
independence of the Syrian Nizaris. It was against this background that 
Sinan now attempted to have Saladin assassinated. The fida'is, how- 
ever, failed to carry out their missions on two separate occasions during 
1174-6, when Saladin was conducting military campaigns in Syria. 
Later, Saladin concluded a truce with Sinan, and the Ayyubids actually 
extended vital assistance to the Syrian Nizaris in their hours of need. 
It also fell uponi n a i  to inaugurate the qiyama for the Nizari 
community in Syria. As reported by Sunni historians, Sinan did 
proclaim, some time after 1164, the spiritual Resurrection of the Syrian 
Nizari community. There are indications, however, that the doctrine of 
the qiyama uwas not fully understood by all the Syrian Nizaris, 
particularly by those who lived in the Jabal al-Summaq and in towns to 
the south of Aleppo. In 1176, a faction of the Nizaris of those districts 
reportedly embarked on a programme of libertinism, attracting the 
attention of outsiders and the Sunni historians of Syria such as Ibn al- 
Adim (d. 1262).Sinan personally dealt with the dissidents, who had 
armed themselves in their mountain strongholds, and ended their 
rebellious activities. The Persian Nizaris were not accused of similar 
behaviour; and even Juwayni does not report any lawlessness there. 
Sinan died in 1192, or 1193, soon after the Syrian fida'is had 
assassinated their most famous Frankish personality, the marquis 
Conrad of Montferrat, King of Jerusalem. 
In the third and final phase of their history during the Alamut period, 
the Nizaris, who had become increasingly weary of their isolation 
within Muslim society, attempted a tactical rapprochement with the 
Sunni world. Immediately upon his accession in 1210, Jalal al-Din 
Hasan 111 (1210-21), the sixth lord of Alamut, publicly repudiated the 
teachings associated with the declaration of the Resurrection and 
proclaimed his adherence to Sunni Islam, ordering his followers to 
observe the sacred law of Islam in its Sunni form. The Nizari 
community, viewing the unprecedented proclamations of their infallible 

The Isma'ilis in History and in Mediaeval Muslim Writings 43 
imam as a reimposition of dissimulation (taqiyya), obeyed Hasan III's 
orders without dissent. The outside world, too, accepted Hasan 111's 
proclamations; and the Abbasid caliph al-Nasir (1180-1225), who in 
the aftermath of the disintegration of Saljuq rule was reviving the 
power and prestige of the caliph at Baghdad, issued a decree confirming 
the Nizari leader's new policy. Hasan III's bold accommodation to the 
outside world accorded the Nizari community a valuable respite from 
the continued Sunni persecutions. During the reign of Hasan 111's son 
and successor, Ala al-Din Muhammad I11 (1221-55), however, enforce- 
ment of Sunni law was gradually relaxed and the Nizari community 
openly reverted to its earlier traditions. 
The long reign of Muhammad 111 coincided with a turbulent period 
in the mediaeval history of Persia and the Muslim East, which now 
experienced a foretaste of the Mongol devastations. Muhammad I11 
attempted in vain for some time to establish friendly relations with the 
Mongols and to save his community from their wrath. The Mongols 
had already been turned against the Nizari Isma'ilis by the Sunni 
scholars at their court; and fresh complaints about them from the Sunni 
judges of Qazwin and other Persian cities flowed into the Great Khan's 
court in Mongolia. As a result, when the Great Khan Mongke (1251-9) 
decided to complete the Mongol conquest of western Asia, he assigned 
first priority to the destruction of the Nizari community in Persia. In 
1252, Mongke entrusted this task to his brother Hulagu, who was to 
lead a major Mongol expedition against the Nizari strongholds and the 
Abbasid caliphate, the two powers that still held out in the Muslim 
lands. 
The Mongols had already started to attack the Nizari strongholds in 
Persia, especially in Khurasan, when Ala al-Din Muhammad I11 was 
succeeded in 1255 by his son Rukn al-Din Khurshah, who reigned for 
just one year as the last ruler of Alamut. After some fierce fighting as 
well as extended negotiations between the Nizari leadership and 
Hulagu, who had arrived in Persia at the head of the main Mongol 
expedition, Khurshah finally surrendered to the Mongols in November 
1256. The surrender of the castle of Alamut a month later marked the 
end of the Persian Nizari state and of the Alamut period in Nizari 
history. Soon after, the Mongols killed Khurshah, the twenty-seventh 
Nizari imam, and massacred the Nizari Isma'ilis of Persia wherever 
they were found. The Syrian Nizaris, demoralized by events in Persia, 
could not maintain their independence for much longer, even though 
they had been spared the Mongol catastrophe. In 1273, Kahf was the 
last of the Syrian strongholds to submit to Baybars I, the Mamluk 
sultan of Egypt and Syria. Unlike the Mongols in Persia, the Mamluks 

and their Ottoman successors permitted the Syrian Nizaris to live in 
their fortresses as a peaceful community. 
In Persia, the Nizaris survived the Mongol massacres and many 
of them sought refuge in Afghanistan, India, Badakhshan and other 
regions of Central Asia. At the same time the Nizari imamate continued 
in the progeny of Rukh al-Din Khurshah. In the early post-Alamut 
centuries, however, the Nizari imams, like their followers in most 
regions, lived clandestinely, often disguising themselves under the 
mantle of Sufism, then flourishing in Persia. By the later decades of the 
fifteenth century, the imams who were by then settled at Anjudan, in 
central Persia, began to revive the Nizari da'wa activities. The imams 
soon succeeded in effectively re-establishing their central control over 
the various Nizari communities, which had developed independently 
under the leadership of their own local dynasties of da'is. The literary 
and proselytising activities of the Nizari da'wa were also revived now, 
leading to the appearance of new types of doctrinal works and an 
increasing number of converts, particularly on the Indian subcontinent. 
By the second half of the eighteenth century, the Nizari imams had also 
appeared on the political scene of Persia as regional governors, while 
the Indian Nizaris, generally known as Khojas, had come to account for 
a large proportion of the Nizari comrnnity."The seat of the Nizari imamate was transferred permanently from 
Persia when the forty-sixth Nizari imam, Hasan Ali Shah (1817-81), 
left his ancestral homeland in 1841 and sought refuge in British India, 
following his military entanglements with the Persian government; in 
1848 he settled in Bombay among his Khoja followers. Hasan Ali Shah, 
who had acquired the epithet of Mahallati after his earlier place of 
residence in central Persia, also received the title of Agha Khan 
(simplified to Aga Khan) from one of the early Qajar monarchs of 
Persia. The title of Aga Khan has been borne on a hereditary basis by 
Hasan Ali Shah's descendants who have succeeded to the Nizari 
imamate. Under the leadership of the two most recent Nizari imams, 
namely, Sultan Muhammad Shah, Aga Khan 111 (1885-1957) and 
his grandson Shah Karim al-Husayni, Aga Khan IV, the forty-ninth 
and current imam of the community, the Nizari Isma'ilis have entered 
the modern world as a progressive and prosperous Shi'i Muslim 
community.

## Mediaeval European Perceptions of Islam and the Isma'ilis
*Pages 52-90*

Mediaeval European Perceptions 
of Islam and the lsma'ilis 
In order to acquire a proper perspective of the genesis of the Assassin 
legends, it is necessary first to take stock of the state of the mediaeval 
Europeans' knowledge and perceptions of Islam as a religion and its 
internal divisions, including especially the Ismaeili branch of Shi'i 
Islam. After all, the Europeans' possible perceptions of the Isma'ilis 
during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, when the legends appeared 
and acquired currency, would have been greatly influenced by their 
overall knowledge of Islam and the religious beliefs and practices of the 
Muslims. 
Soon after the Prophet Muhammad's death in 632, as the Muslim 
armies embarked on their wars of conquest outside the Arabian 
peninsula, and the boundaries of the nascent Islamic state were rapidly 
being extended both to the east and the west, Islam began to impress 
outsiders as a thunderous military might bent on territorial expansion. 
The subjects of the neighbouring Byzantine and Sasanid empires were 
among the first of the conquered peoples to be deeply shocked by the 
victories of the Muslims, though their conversion to Islam was never 
demanded forcibly by their new conquerors. However, Christendom 
suffered a humiliating defeat when Muslim soldier-tribesmen occupied 
parts of the Byzantine empire in Syria and elsewhere in the seventh 
century; and Christian Europeans were even more alarmed when the 
Muslims extended their hegemony from North Africa to Spain in the 
eighth century, and later, in the ninth century, to Sicily and other 
western Mediterranean islands. 
Thus, the seeds of prolonged antagonism between the Christian and 
Muslim worlds were planted, and Islam, the 'Other' world, began to be 
perceived as a problem by western Christendom, a problem which in 
time acquired important religious and intellectual dimensions, in 
addition to its original political and military aspects. However, this 

complex problem, which had aroused so much fear and apprehension 
in Christian Europe, seemed to defy any easy solution, as subsequent 
Christian-Muslim encounters during the Middle Ages were to confirm. 
Indeed, Islam had now become a lasting trauma for Europe;' and this 
basically negative perception of Islam was retaioed for almost a 
thousand years, well into the seventeenth century when the Ottoman 
Turks, who had rekindled the past aspirations and glories of the 
Muslims in their own impressive empire, still represented a serious 
military threat to the peace and stability of Christendom and western 
Europe. 
Alarmed by the expanding fortunes of the Muslims and their military 
exploits, how did Christian Europe respond to the challenge of Islam? 
Originally, Europeans were both unwilling and unable to take up arms 
against this new enemy on their frontiers, although a military reaction 
did materialize several centuries later in the Crusading movement. 
Indeed, for almost four centuries, Europeans effectively chose to ignore 
Islam, both as a military and an intellectual phenomenon, also denying 
its status as a new monotheistic religion in the Judaeo-Christian 
tradition. Under such circumstances, the Europeans' perceptions of 
Islam were essentially rooted in fear and ignorance, resulting in a highly 
distorted and absurd image of Islam in western minds. It is also 
important td recall that this image was generally retained throughout 
the Middle Ages and beyond, even though Europeans had gradually 
found access to information about Islam from different sources. 
Western ignorance of Islam and the resulting misconceptions had their 
own evolutionary process in the Middle Ages; and there were also those 
rare 'moments' when attempts were made by a few individuals to study 
Islam in a more serious fashion, even though they, too, pursued 
polemical goals. In recent decades, a number of scholars, notably 
Norman Daniel (d. 1992) and Richard Southern, have investigated the 
complex Christian-Muslim encounters of mediaeval times, attempting 
to identify various stages in the development of the Europeans' 
conception of Islam; this chapter owes much to their scholaship.During the first few centuries of contact between Christendom and 
Islam, lasting until around the end of the eleventh century when the 
Crusading movement began, knowledge about Islam was extremely 
limited in Europe, as were the scattered sources of this knowledge; 
these sources included the polemical works of St John of Damascus, 
one of the great theologians of the Eastern Church who lived in 
Umayyad Syria, and those of the Byzantine theologians, as well as the 
occasional reports of the Mozarabs, Christians living in Spain under 
Muslim domination. In the course of these early centuries of Christian- 

Mediaeval European Perceptions of Islam and the Isma'ilis 
Muslim encounters, designated by Southern as the 'age of ignorance', 
Europeans viewed Islam as one of their major enemies and they 
attempted to understand it and interpret its religious status solely in the 
light of the Bible. The distant origins of the Muslims, or the Saracens as 
they came to be called incorrectly in mediaeval Europe, were relent- 
lessly sought in the Old Testament. It was Bede (d. 739, the Biblical 
master of the early Middle Ages in northern Europe, who lent currency 
to the identification of the Muslims with the Saracens, or the Ishmaelite 
descendants of Abraham by Hagar, even though the people in question 
could not be called Saracens (sons of Sarah) because they descended 
from Abraham through Hagar and not Sarah, Abraham's other wife. 
At any rate, Muslims were now placed in opposition to Christians even 
on the basis of Biblical hist01-y.Bede, in fact, regarded the Muslims as 
unbelievers. 
There were also those Europeans who turned from Biblical history to 
Biblical prophecy for their understanding of Islam. In this connection, 
around the middle of the ninth century, several Christian theologians 
living in Spain, including Eulogius (d. 859), Bishop of Toledo, saw in 
Islam a sinister conspiracy against Christianity; for them, Muhammad 
was the Anti-Christ and the rise of Islam heralded the imminent end of 
the world. This apocalyptic vision of Islam, too, was solidly rooted in 
ignorance, although its protagonists actually lived among Muslims and 
could obtain some information about their religion. 
By the final decades of the eleventh century, Europeans had begun 
to respond militarily to the challenge of Islam by means of the 
Reconquista in Muslim Spain and the Crusading movement. The 
political fragmentation of Spain, in the aftermath of the collapse of 
Umayyad rule there in 1031, made it possible for the independent 
Christian kingdoms of the north to expand their territories southwards. 
This marked the beginning of the Christian Reconquista which 
culminated in the conquest of Toledo in 1085. The early success of the 
Reconquista was halted for more than a century by the intervention, 
from North Africa, of the Muslim Almoravids and their successors in 
the Almohad dynasty. But when they abandoned Spain, most of its 
Muslim cities, including Cordova, fell into Christian hands during the 
thirteenth century. However, Muslim rule under the Nasirids continued 
for another two and a half centuries in the province of Granada, which 
was transformed into a flourishing centre of Islamic culture. With the 
union of Castile and Aragon which brought about the unification of 
Spain, Granada, the last Muslim bastion in Spain, fell to the Christians 
in 1492. 
In the meantime, the Crusading movement for fighting the enemies of 

Christendom in the East had been launched in Europe in response to 
the appeal made, in November 1095, by Pope Urban 11 (1088-99) at 
the Council of Clermont in France. The original papal appeal stressed 
the need for providing military support for the eastern Christians who 
were allegedly subjected to the oppressive rule of the Muslims; the 
Europeans themselves had for some time deemed it undesirable that 
their Holy Places and pilgrimage routes in Palestine should be under 
Muslim control. In fact, a new era in Christian-Muslim encounters was 
about to commence in the form of numerous Crusades to the Holy 
Land, where the Crusaders acquired permanent bases for the next two 
centries.Following the papal appeal of 1095, numerous Crusading con- 
tingents were quickly mobilized by different princes and knights in 
western Europe. The Christian pilgrim-soldiers of the mixed army of 
the First Crusade began to arrive in Constantinople, the Byzantine 
capital, in 1096; by 1097 they had already entered Syria. The 
Crusaders then marched towards their final destination, Jerusalem, 
which a year earlier had fallen once again into Fatimid hands. The 
Crusaders easily defeated the local Fatimid garrison and entered 
Jerusalem in July 1099; thereupon the Crusading pilgrims massacred 
practically the entire Muslim and Jewish populations of Jerusalem 
before giving thanks to God for their victory in the Church of the Holy 
Sepulchre. Jerusalem had now been recovered for Christendom. 
The swift victory of the First Crusade (1096-9) was in no small 
measure due to political decline and disunity in the Muslim camp. The 
major Muslim powers had been engaged in prolonged rivalries of their 
own, to the detriment of their overall military strength, while the 
Levant had recently become the scene of factional fighting among the 
Saljuqs and other regional powers. Syria and Palestine had long been 
contested by the Isma'ili Fatimids and the Sunni Abbasids, the major 
caliphal powers in the Near East, with a number of local dynasties and 
tribal rulers contributing further to the region's political intricacies. By 
1097, when the Crusaders appeared in Syria, the declining Fatimid 
dynasty had lost its earlier political prominence in the Levant; and the 
Nizari-Mustacli schism of 1094 had further devastated the fortunes of 
the Fatimids, affecting their control of the eastern Islamic lands beyond 
Egypt. On the other side, the Abbasid caliphs themselves had long been 
reduced to mere puppets at Baghdad in the hands of the Saljuq sultans, 
though they were retained as the official spokesmen of Sunni Islam. The 
Saljuq sultanate, too, had passed its apogee; and with the death of 
sultan Malikshah in 1092, the Saljuqs were experiencing their own 

Mediaeval European Perceptions of Islam and the Isma'ilis 
succession problems and internal disputes. In Syria proper, which had 
been transformed into a somewhat independent Saljuq principality, the 
death in 1095 of its Saljuq overlord, Tumsh, had led to a prolonged 
period of political instability, with Tutush's two sons ruling in rivalry 
with one another over different parts of Syria from Aleppo and 
Damascus. The situation was further complicated by the activities of 
various local dynasties which now aspired to assert their own 
independence. 
All this explains why the potentially superior Muslim forces failed so 
helplessly to check the advance of the Crusaders into the Holy Land. It 
was left for Saladin, the founder of the Ayyubid dynasty, to unite the 
Muslims some eight decades later in a jihad or holy war of their own 
against the Crusaders. Having uprooted the Fatimids in 1171, Saladin 
succeeded in unifying Egypt and Syria under his own rule; he then led 
his unified army of Turks, Arabs and Kurds in common cause against 
the Crusaders, culminating in the Muslim recapture of Jerusalem in 
1187. The Franks or al-Faranj, as the Crusaders and western 
Europeans in general had come to be designated by the Muslims, had 
now lost, at least temporarily, most of their important possessions in 
the Levant, except for a few coastal towns. 
In the immediate aftermath of the First Crusade, its Frankish leaders 
established four small states in the conquered territories of the Near 
East, a region which became known to them as Outremer, or the 'land 
beyond the sea'. The Frankish states of Edessa and Antioch, established 
respectively by Baldwin of Boulogne and Bohemond, guarded the 
north-eastern and northern approaches to Syria. Jerusalem with a few 
towns along the coast and in the highlands formed another state, the 
Latin kingdom of Jerusalem, which enjoyed supremacy among the 
Frankish territories by the virtue of possessing the Holy Places. The first 
Frankish ruler in Jerusalem, elected by other leaders of the First 
Crusade, was Godfrey of Bouillon (1099-1100), who would be called 
Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri, 'the defender of the Holy Sepulchre'; he 
was soon succeeded by his younger brother, Baldwin I of Boulogne 
(1100-18), who had earlier established the state of Edessa. After 
capturing the port of Tortosa in 1102, a fourth Frankish principality, 
based later on Tripoli, was founded by Raymond of St Gilles (d. 1105), 
foremost among the early leaders of the Crusades.' 
Soon, there also appeared two military monastic orders of knights, 
the Hospitallers and the Templars, founded in 1113 and 1119 
respectively. Acting as autonomous powers accountable directly only to 
the papacy, they provided military assistance to the Crusaders in the 
Frankish states and also guarded the pilgrim routes of the Holy Land. 

Growing steadily in numbers and in wealth, these military orders had 
large and well-organized fighting forces at their disposal and also 
possessed numerous castles in the region, in the vicinity of the fortresses 
later acquired in Syria by the Nizaris. During the twelfth century, the 
knights of these orders had extended encounters with the Syrian Nizari 
Isma'ilis. 
The Frankish territories in Outremer had colourful histories of their 
own until their final collapse in the closing decades of the thirteenth 
century. Modelling themselves largely on the feudal structure then 
prevalent in western Europe, the leaders of the Frankish states entered 
into an endless series of local conflicts and alliances among themselves, 
also establishing shifting relations with the Muslim rulers of the region, 
including the leaders of the Nizari Isma'ili community in Syria. The 
political and diplomatic fabric of the region was further complicated by 
the independent activities of the rival Hospitallers and Templars, who 
also had their own hostile relations with the Isma'ilis and often 
successfully exacted tribute from them. 
Of the four Latin states, Edessa had the shortest history; it was lost 
to the Zangids of Iraq and Syria in 1144, an event that led to the 
indecisive Second Crusade (1 147-8). Meanwhile, Bohemond's nephew 
Tancred had effectively succeeded to the leadership of the principality 
of Antioch in 1101. Tancred (d. 1112) was the first Crusading prince 
who came into contact with the Nizari Ismaeilis, who were then 
securing a temporary foothold in northern Syria. Later, Antioch was 
ruled by the princes of the house of Hauteville until it was captured in 
1268 by Baybars 1, the same Mamluk sultan who finally subdued the 
Syrian Nizari Isma'ilis in the early 1270s. Tripoli was ruled by the 
descendants of Raymond of St Gilles until 1187, when it, too, passed to 
the house of Hauteville. Tripoli was eventually captured by the 
Mamluks in 1289, leaving only the Latin kingdom in Frankish hands. 
The kingdom of Jerusalem was restored soon after the seizure of 
Jerusalem by Saladin in 1187, with Acre serving as its new capital. The 
leadership of the kingdom had then fallen intermittently into the hands 
of King Amalric 1's daughters, Sibylla and Isabella, and some of their 
husbands, including Guy of Lusignan (1 186-92), Conrad of Montfer- 
rat (1192) and Henry of Champagne (1192-7), some of whom had 
dealings with the most famous leader of the Syrian Nizari Ismaeili 
community, namely, Rashid al-Din Sinan. In 1291, the Mamluks 
conquered Acre and what remained of the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem, 
ending Frankish rule in Outremer. 
The events of the Crusades and the four Frankish states in Outremer, 
especially those relating to the Latin kingdom, have been recorded by 

Mediaeval European Perceptions of Islam and the Isma'ilis 
numerous contemporary occidental chroniclers who flourished during 
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Some of these chroniclers actually 
lived in the Latin East and were eyewimesses to some of the events they 
describe. As such, they represent highly important primary sources for 
the Crusaders' knowledge of contemporary Muslims and Isma'ilis. 
William, Archbishop of Tyre, was the greatest of the Crusader 
historians who lived and worked in the Latin East. He was also the 
earliest of the occidental chroniclers of the Crusades to have written 
about the Syrian Nizari Isma'ilis. His famous Historia contains a 
detailed account of the Crusades as well as the history of the lands 
conquered by the Crusaders, in particular the Latin kingdom of 
Jerusalem from 1095 to 1184.He also makes numerous references to 
the relations between the Crusaders and the Fatimids. It is important to 
note that for the period 1120-84, William's Historia is the only 
contemporary or near-contemporary historical account of the Latin 
East written by a Christian resident in that region. In addition, being 
learned and a man of public affairs, he was very well informed about 
his subject, having had access to both literary and oral sources then 
existing in Outremer. 
William of Tyre was born in Jerusalem in or about 1130. He spent 
almost 20 years (circa 1146-65) studying in France and Italy. He 
entered public service soon after returning to the Latin East in 1165. In 
1170, he was recruited to the service of King Amalric I (1 163-74), who 
in 1174 appointed him to the office of Chancellor of the Latin 
kingdom; he also acted as tutor to Amalric's son and successor Baldwin 
IV (1 174-85). William was elected Archbishop of Tyre in 1175, and as 
such he ranked second only to the Patriarch of Jerusalem in the 
ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Latin kingdom. William spent many years 
compiling his annalistic history, writing its final sections in 1184 
shortly before he died. William knew Arabic but, according to his own 
statements, he did not utilize any literary Arabic sources, although he 
did rely extensively on oral traditions.' Indeed, the oral traditions and 
memoirs of others, in addition to his own experiences, and the earlier 
Christian narratives of the First Crusade were the main primary sources 
of his Historia.* Among other early occidental chronicles, he particu- 
larly relied on the anonymously written Gesta Francorumwhich had 
been also used by Raymond of Aguilers and Fulcher of Chartres, 
authorities on the First Crusade, who in turn were used by William of 
Tyre. William evidently also wrote a history of the Muslim lands, 
which has not been recovered. Strangely enough, his Historia does not 
contain any important information on Islam as a religion; this was 
clearly not one of his concerns. In line with the tradition established by 

the earlier historians of the Crusading movement, William's main 
objective was to show that the Crusade was a holy war against the 
Saracen infidels, and that its triumphs were, therefore, Gesta Dei per 
Francos, divine deeds done through the Franks. 
The Crusaders themselves were not interested in gathering accurate 
information about the Muslims and their religion, a lack of interest 
which becomes all the more significant when it is recalled that both 
they and some of their learned historians, such as William of Tyre and 
James of Vitry (d. 1240), lived for long periods in close proximity to 
the Muslims, with whom they had extensive military, diplomatic, social 
and commercial contacts. In the aftermath of the First Crusade, 
Crusaders who had come from northern France, Provence, Lorraine 
and other parts of western Europe, began to settle in the territories of 
the Latin states in Outremer. Their ranks were continuously swelled by 
waves of newcomers from the West. The Crusaders brought with them 
ideas and institutions from the feudal society of mediaeval Europe, 
which they put into practice with very little regard for the indigenous 
realities of the Latina s i .  As a result, a very complex social structure 
developed in the territories of the Latin states, which were now ruled by 
a class of Frankish nobility.'' Besides the Crusading knights and higher 
nobility, the Frankish settlers also included burgesses who dwelled in 
the towns sand engaged in small-scale domestic trade. The larger 
international trade was in the hands of Venetian and other European 
concerns in Acre, Tyre and other ports of Outremer. Native Christian, 
Muslim and Jewish communities occupied lower ranks in the social 
system of the Latin East. The more numerous oriental Christians, who 
spoke Arabic and belonged mainly to the Greek Orthodox Church, and 
on whose behalf the Crusading movement had been launched, became 
second-class citizens of the Frankish states; and the Muslim inhabitants 
of these territories, many of whom were engaged in the cultivation of 
land for the Crusader lords, occupied even a lower social status and 
paid a special poll-tax to the Franks. 
In this complex social setting, the feudal superstructure of the Latin 
states was quite separate from the indigenous society, although there 
were extensive contacts between them. The Frankish rulers and the 
Crusader settlers were, in effect, sustained by an Arabic-speaking 
indigenous community, comprised mainly of Muslims. Many of the 
Frankish settlers themselves learned to speak Arabic, while they also 
utilized the services of Muslim scribes. Thus, the Crusaders had varied 
encounters with the Muslim inhabitants of the Latin states and the 
neighbouring Muslim states, but there was very little cultural contact 
between them, such as existed in Muslim Spain and Sicily. As a result, 

Mediaeval European Perceptions of Islam and the Isma'ilis 
the Crusaders remained in ignorance of almost every aspect of Islam as 
a religion or civilization. 
In sum, direct contact between the Franks and the Muslims, during 
the First Crusade and subsequently, did not result in improved western 
perceptions of Islam, either in the Latin East or in Europe. As a result of 
the Crusading movement, however, Europeans did become more aware 
of the reality of Islam; and in the aftermath of the military victories of 
the First Crusade, their earlier fears about Islam gave way, at least 
temporarily, to hopeful aspirations. 
Thus, Islam and its founder became more familiar concepts in 
Europe from the early decades of the twelfth century, but these 
concepts were largely based on imagination. In the words of Southern, 
the authors of this picture had luxuriated in the ignorance of 
triumphant imagination." Based on oral testimony and misinforma- 
tion, and stimulated significantly by the fireside tales of the returning 
Crusaders, this picture of Islam was fabricated at a time of great 
imaginative development in western Europe, which was then also 
witnessing the appearance of a host of European tales such as the 
romances of Charlemagne, the legends of Virgil, and the legendary 
history of Britain. It is, therefore, not surprising that legends about 
Islam circulated so readily, purporting to be accurate descriptions of 
Muslims and their practices at least until the middle of the thirteenth 
century. According to these legends, which like the contemporary 
Assassin legends soon acquired a literary life of their own, the Saracens 
(Muslims) were idolators worshipping a false trinity, and Mahomet 
(Muhammad) was a magician; he was even a cardinal of the Roman 
Church who had rebelled and fled to Arabia where he founded a church 
of his own.12 
In the meantime, some scattered but highly valuable attempts were 
made by a few individuals in Europe to study Islam on a more serious 
basis, supplementing fiction with observation and textual analysis, 
though their basic aim continued to remain refutation and con- 
demnation. This new spirit of enquiry, which led to the first factual 
observations about Islam as a religion in Europe, appeared mainly in 
Spain; and its earliest protagonist was Moses Sefardi (d. ca. 1130), a 
Spanish Jew who in 1106 converted to Christianity, adopted the name 
of Pedro de Alfonso and later went to live in England where he became 
physician to King Henry I. Having lived among the Muslims in Spain, 
Pedro de Alfonso knew Arabic and was the first translator into Latin of 
some of the stories circulating in the Muslim East; he also seems to 
have acquired a good knowledge of the Quran in addition to some first- 
hand information about Muslim tenets and practices. At any rate, he 

5 8 
produced the earliest written account of Islam and Muhammad in the 
fifth of his Dialogi, containing dialogues between a Christian and ae w . 'Pedro de Alfonso's polemical account of Islam, composed 
around 1108 on the basis of oral traditions as well as written sources 
which remain unknown, was the best informed statement on the 
subject throughout the twelfth century and, perhaps, the later Middle 
Ages. But his account did not have a widespread influence on the 
Europeans' perceptions of Islam. 
A far more ambitious project to gather factual knowledge about 
Islam was launched through the efforts of Peter the Venerable, abbot of 
the important Benedictine monastery of Cluny in France from 1122 
until his death in 1156. Peter the Venerable had a deep concern for 
guarding Christianity against heresies; for him, Islam represented the 
greatest of these. He was also convinced that instead of defeating them 
militarily, Muslims could more readily be won over through missionary 
activity. For both of these reasons, he was concerned to collect accurate 
information about Islam,. in particular about its weaknesses, so that the 
false tenets of this religion could then be exposed. It was with these 
objectives in mind that, while on a journey to Spain in 1142, he 
conceived a grandiose project involving the translation of a number of 
Islamic texts, including the Quran, from Arabic into Latin. He 
entrusted this task to a team of translators in Toledo, which had 
recently become a centre for the translation of Arabic scientific works 
into Latin. 
The Latin translation of the Quran, a landmark in western Islamic 
studies and now undertaken for the first time by Robert of Ketton, was 
completed in 1143 with the title of Liber legis Saracenorum quem 
Alcoran vocant; Peter the Venerable himself utilized his commissioned 
translations to produce a summary of Islamic teachings (Summa totius 
haeresis Saracenorum), and an anti-Islamic polemic (Liber contra 
sectam sive haeresim Saacenorum).'The results of this project, a 
dozen Latin texts known as the Culniac Corpus or the Toledo 
Cllection,'constituted the first scholarly instruments for studying 
Islam in mediaeval Europe. The synthesizing tracts composed by Peter 
the Venerable himself were free from many of the crude and absurd 
misconceptions then current in Europe. But the Culniac Corpus, too, 
failed to have any immediate impact on Europeans' perceptions, despite 
its rather wide circulation. The serious study of Islam did not present 
itself as a generally attractive objective to Christian Europeans who 
were then, in the second half of the twelfth century, still hopeful of 
defeating the Muslims through the Crusades; consequently, legends 
about the Muslim East continued to be circulated in the Latin West as 

Mediaeval European Perceptions of Islam and the Isma'ilis 
well as among the Crusading circles in Outremer. Legends about Islam, 
accepted as reliable accounts, had by now acquired a life of their own. 
By the end of the twelfth century, another type of factual knowledge 
about the philosophical achievements of the Muslims was becoming 
accessible in Europe, at least to the learned Latins. This new knowledge 
of Muslim philosophy was obviously at great variance with the 
negative religio-political image of Islam still in circulation. Numerous 
treatises of the most renowed Muslim philosophers, including al-Kindi, 
al-Farabi and Ibn Sina (Latin, Avicenna), were now for the first time 
rendered from Arabic into Latin by Gerard of Cremona (d. 1187) and 
others belonging to that famous group of translators connected with 
Toledo, opening up new intellectual vistas to western thinkers.l6 Thus, 
not only did learred Europeans like Roger Bacon (d. 1292) now 
become awarr of the impressive intellectual achievements of the 
Muslims, but they also began to adopt some of the ideas and 
methodologies of the Muslim philosophers in their own theological and 
philosophical discourses. Even recognition of the philosophical achieve- 
ments of the Muslims failed to dispel the European legends about Islam 
as a religion. 
Meanwhile, Christian Europeans had retained their hope of crushing 
the Muslims through military power; and this hope was temporarily 
reinvigorated by the appearance of the Mongols. The thunderous 
victories of Chingiz Khan during the early decades of the thirteenth 
century had brought to the notice of Europeans the existence of a 
pagan world beyond Islam in Asia. The appearance of the Mongols, 
generally known in the Latin West as Tartars (derived from Tartarus, 
the Latin term for the Hell of classical mythology), significantly 
broadened the geographical and religious horizons of western Christen- 
dom. It also had an important impact on Christian-Muslim relations. 
After some initial confusion, the Europeans recognized the Mongols as 
a suitable instrument for destroying the Muslims and, hence, made 
numerous diplomatic efforts to forge an alliance with them against the 
Muslims. At the same time, the Muslims, who had already experienced 
a foretaste of Mongol devastation, made peaceful overtures of their 
own, hoping to avert further catastrophes. It was in this spirit that the 
ambassadors of the Abbasid caliph at Baghdad and the Nizari Isma'ili 
ruler at Alamut went to Mongolia, in 1246, on the occasion of the 
enthronement of the Great Khan Guyuk. The Muslims had already 
failed in their attempts to win the support of the Christians against the 
Mongols. According to Matthew Paris (d. 1259), the English Benedic- 
tine monk and historian, in 1238 the Isma'ili ruler of Alamut and the 
Abbasid caliph had sent a joint mission to Europe to seek the assistance 

of King Louis IX of France and King Henry 111 of England against the 
Mongols. But the envoys had found no sympathy for their cause at the 
European courts." At any rate, a most intricate series of embassies and 
messages were now exchanged between the European powers and the 
Mongols, and between the latter and the Muslim rulers, in addition to 
the less noteworthy Christian-Muslim diplomatic encounters of the 
time. 
It was against this background that King Louis IX of France, better 
known as St Louis, led the Seventh Crusade (1248-54), the last major 
Crusader campaign, and also entered into diplomatic negotiations with 
the Mongols. After his early defeat in 1250 at Damietta, however, St 
Louis went to Acre and remained in Palestine for four years until 1254. 
During this period he exchanged embassies and gif'ts with the Old Man 
of the Mountain, the then local leader of the Nizari Ismaeilis in Syria. 
Encouraged by the news of the Mongols' inclination towards Nestorian 
Christianity, St Louis also sought to establish an alliance with the 
Mongols against the Muslims. In pursuit of this objective he dispatched 
a Flemish Franciscan friar, William of Rubruck, on a mission to the 
court of the Great Khan Mongke in Mongolia. In 1254, William 
reached the Mongol capital Karakorum, where he participated in a 
great theological debate before Mongke with representatives of the 
Nestorian Christians, Buddhists and Muslims. William of Rubruck has 
left a valuable account of this debate1* and other events of his mission 
to Mongolia, in which he refers to the Persian Ismaeilis. He also related 
that a large group of Ismaeili fidu'is had entered Karakorum in 1254 
under different guises for the purpose of killing Mongke, who had 
already sent a major expedition under the command of his brother 
Hulagu against the Isma'ili strongholds in persia.19 
Soon afterwards, the Mongols completed, on their own initiative, 
their conquest of western Asia, causing the destructions of the Nizari 
Ismaeili state of Persia in 1256 and that of the Abbasid caliphate in 
1258. Their further advance was successfully checked in Syria by the 
Muslims. As a result, the Latin states of Outremer, too, survived for a 
few decades longer. Western hopes for a joint Christian-Mongol attack 
against Islam were once again temporarily revived when the Mongols 
sent their own embassies to Europe between 1285 and 1290. But these 
negotiations, too, proved fruitless, and the fall of Acre into Muslim 
hands in 1291 initiated yet another chapter in Christian-Muslim 
relations; it not only marked the collapse of Frankish rule and military 
presence in Outremer, but also dispelled any remaining Christian hopes 
for a lasting military victory over the Muslims. The Crusading 
movement had finally run its course after almost two centuries (1096- 

Mediaeval European Perceptions of Islam and the Isma'ilis 
1291) of pilgrimage and holy war; and the historical reality of Islam 
was now about to receive some recognition by the Europeans and 
Christendom. 
In the meantime, individual attempts of a somewhat scholarly nature 
to study Islam for polemical purposes had continued in Europe, 
reaching their culmination in the works of Raymond Lull (d. 1315) and 
Ricoldo da Monte Croce (d. 1321). Expressing a Christian point of 
view, these men talked of replacing the Crusading movement by 
missionary endeavours among the Muslims, endeavours that would 
require serious studies of the Islamic tenets and languages.20 Lull 
himself founded, in 1276, a school of Arabic for future Christian 
missionaries in Majorca; and in no small measure it was due to his 
ideas that the Council of Vienne in 1311 recommended that chairs of 
oriental languages be established at five European universities. These 
efforts, too, had few lasting results. By the end of the fourteenth 
century, the number of people who knew Arabic in Europe was 
probably less than 20; and missionary efforts, going back to the earlier 
activities of Franciscan and Dominican friars who were employed from 
1234 as preachers of the Crusades, had all proved ineffective. 
Indeed, during the fourteenth century and later Middle Ages, the 
impulse to know and understand Islam died out almost completely, and 
popular imagination was once again given a free rein. In particular, the 
colourful eastern tales of Marco Polo gave new impetus to European 
fantasies about Islam and the Muslim East. By the end of the fifteenth 
century, the standard Christian perception of Islam, sanctioned by the 
Roman Church, still represented a highly distorted image rooted in 
ignorance and fantasy. According to W.M. Watt, the four main 
features of this image, which essentially retained a central place in 
European thinking until the nineteenth century, were as follows: (1) the 
religion of Islam was falsehood and a deliberate perversion of truth: 
(2) it was a religion of violence and the sword: (3) it was a religion of 
self-indulgence; and (4) Muhammad was the Anti-Chrit.' 
With the fall of the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, in 1453 into 
the hands of the Ottoman Turks, now the major Muslim power, the 
interest of Christian theologians in Islam was reawakened for a brief 
period, designated by Southern as 'the moment of vision'.= None the 
less, by the end of the Middle Ages, the accumulated knowledge of 
Europeans about Islam was still extraordinarily negligible. 
Considerations of the later developments in European perceptions of 
Islam and the early histories of Orientalism and Islamic studies in the 
West, are beyond the scope of this enquiry. It is sufficient to recall that 
the beginnings of systematic studies of Islamic theology and history in 

Europe may be traced to the late sixteenth century, the century of the 
Reformation, when regular teaching of Arabic commenced at the 
ColKge de France in Paris; and it was only after the establishment of 
chairs of Arabic at Leiden in 1613 and at Cambridge and Oxford in the 
1630s that serious studies of Arabic sources really began in Europe. 
However, it was not until the end of the seventeenth century that 
scientific attitudes towards the study of Islam finally began to displace 
the narrow and strictly polemical frame of mind within which all the 
mediaeval Christian investigations of Islam had been conducted. The 
disappearance of the general tendency to prefer false and polemical 
statements to objective knowledge based on authentic textual evidence, 
together with an increased availability of rich collections of Islamic 
manuscripts in the Bibliothique Royale and other libraries in Europe, 
finally prepared the ground for the scholarly study of Islam within the 
broader field of Orientalism in early modern times. 
If the mediaeval Europeans, both in the West and in Outremer, were 
ignorant of the most basic aspects of the Islamic message, they surely 
knew even less about its internal divisions, including the broad Sunni- 
Shi'i division, and the intricacies of Islamic sects and tenets. Indeed, 
there is no evidence to suggest that even the most learned of the 
Crusader historians, who spent long periods in the Latin East where 
they had continuous contacts with the local Muslims, made any efforts 
to gather details on the Muslim communities of the region. Ironically, 
some of these occidental historians, such as William of Tyre and James 
of Vitry, were theologians who served as bishops and archbishops in 
the Crusader states and also aimed at converting members of the local 
Muslim communities. This is in marked contrast to the practices of the 
contemporary or even earlier Ismaeili &is who, as a matter of policy, 
familiarized themselves with the religions and languages of their 
prospective converts; while many of these da'is received extensive 
training at the Dar al-Hikma and other special institutions of learning 
in Fatimid Cairo. Modern scholarship has revealed, for instance, that 
al-Kirmani, an eminent Isma'ili philosopher and the most learned da'i- 
theologian of the Fatimid period, was well acquainted with the Judaeo- 
Christian scriptures and the Hebrew and Syriac languages;23 he died 
around 1021, when Christian theologians were still investigating Islam 
on the basis of the Bible and the name of Muhammad was practically 
unknown to Christians in Europe outside Spain and Sicily. 
Perceiving Islam as a false religion or even as a Christian heresy, the 
Crusaders and their historians were not interested in acquiring facts 
and first-hand knowledge about Islam. On the contrary, they aimed to 
refute and condemn a phenomenon that represented something evil to 

Mediaeval European Perceptions of Islam and the Ismdilis 
them; and, under these circumstances, their purpose would be more 
readily served by fabricating or imagining the required evidence, in 
addition to believing in false reports or exaggerating half-truths about 
the tenets and practices of the Muslims or any segment of their 
community, including especially the 'Assassins' who had attracted the 
attention of the Crusaders. 
Mediaeval Europeans remained almost completely ignorant of Shi'i 
Islam and its main doctrinal differences with the Sunni majority, even 
though the Crusaders had come into contact from the opening years of 
the twelfth century with Shi'i communities as represented by the Nizari 
Isma'ilis in Syria and the Fatimids in Egypt. The Crusaders obviously 
also failed to realize that the Syrian Nizaris and the Fatimids belonged 
to the rival wings of Isma'ilism, which itself represented a major 
branch of Shi'i Islam; nor were they aware that the Imami Twelver 
communities, then present in Syria and other regions of the Near East, 
constituted another major branch of Shi'ism. 
Nevertheless, as a result of their contacts with Shi'i (Isma'ili) 
Muslims, the Crusaders had somehow become aware, though in a 
highly confused manner, of the differences that separated the Shi'a 
from the rest of the Muslim community. For instance, William of Tyre, 
the earliest Crusader historian who has something to say on the subject, 
summed up around 1180 his knowledge of Shi'ism by merely stating 
that, according to the Shi'a, God had intended to entrust the message 
of Islam to Hali (Ali), the only true prophet, but the angel Gabriel erred 
and handed the message to Mehemeth (u h a m m a d ) .Later Crusader 
historians basically drew upon his statements. James of Vitry (Jacques 
de Vitri), another well-informed Crusader historian who was Bishop of 
Acre from 1216 to 1228, shows some awareness of the ritual 
differences between Sunnis and Shi'is, but he too misunderstands these 
differences and states that the followers of Ali observed a law different 
from that instituted by Muhammad who, according to him, was 
slandered by the Shi'a.= Even Ricoldo da Monte Croce, who later 
made a more serious study of Islam and journeyed to the Near East 
where he evidently talked to some Twelver Shi'is in Iraq, was way off 
the mark in believing that the majority of Muslims followed Muham- 
mad, while fewer members followed Ali, holding that Ali's rights had 
been usurped by Mh a m m a d .It was only after the adoption of Twelver Shi'ism as the state religion 
of Safavid Persia in 1501 that the Europeans travelling to that land 
began to collect more reliable information about Shi'ism. Even that 
proved to be a slow process as is shown by the available accounts 
produced by Portuguese, Spanish, Italian and other European emissar- 

ies, merchants, diplomats and travellers visiting Persia in Safavid and 
later times. Indeed, even in modern times Shi'i studies have remained 
on the periphery of Islamic studies in the West, where Islamicists still 
continue to investigate Islam mainly from the viewpoint of the Sunnis 
and the Arabs. At any rate, in the light of the Crusaders' complete 
ignorance of Shi'i Islam, including its main Twelver and Isma'ili 
branches, it is reasonable to assume that they must have been equally 
ill-informed about the actual beliefs and practices of the Nizari 
Isma'ilis. The remainder of this chapter reviews the available evidence 
on 'Crusader-Assassin' encounters and the extent of the Crusaders' 
factual knowledge about the Nizari Isma'ilis during the twelfth and 
thirteenth centuries. It is only against this background that a proper 
understanding of how the Assassin legends were generated and 
transmitted in mediaeval times can be acquired. 
A few years after the fall of Jerusalem into the Crusaders' hands, 
Persian emissaries of Hasan Sabbah began to arrive in northern Syria to 
organize and lead the Nizari Isma'ili movement there. As already 
noted, these Nizari &is found their task much more arduous in Syria, 
and almost half a century of continuous efforts were needed before they 
could finally realize their objective and gain control of a group of 
strongholds. From early on, the Nizari dacis in Syria came into contact 
and conflict with the Crusaders who had already started to extend their 
military presence in the region. During an initial period lasting until 
1113, Nizari activities in Syria were centred on Aleppo, where the 
sectarians had found a temporary protector in the city's Saljuq ruler, 
Ridwan. It was perhaps due to a cooperative pact that the first local 
chief of the Syrian Nizaris, a Persian & i  known as al-Hakim al- 
Munajjim (the Physician-Astrologer), dispatched a group of fidu'is to 
kill Janah al-Dawla, the ruler of Hims and one of Ridwan's main 
enemies. The assassins themselves were killed on the spot by Janah al- 
Dawla's guards. This event, taking place in May 1103 during a Friday 
prayer in the great mosque of Hims, was the first of the daring public 
assassinations committed by the Syrian Nizaris, self-sacrificing acts 
which were to attract so much attention in Crusader circles. 
Operating from their base in Aleppo, the Nizaris next extended their 
influence to Apamea, a fortified outpost of Aleppo which fell easily into 
their hands in 1106, upon the assassination of its ruler at the hands of a 
group of fida'is. But the attempt to make Apamea the first Nizari 
stronghold in Syria proved short-lived. A few months later, in 
September 1106, Tancred, the able regent of Antioch who had already 
occupied the surrounding districts, successfully besieged Apamea and 
forced its surrender. Abu Tahir, the new Nizari chief, and his close 

Mediaeval European Perceptions of Islam and the Isma'ilis 
associates, who then stayed at Apamea, ransomed themselves from 
captivity and returned to Aleppo. These events at Apamea marked the 
first encounters between the Crusaders and the Nizari Isma'ilis of 
Syria. A few years later, in 1110, the Syrian Nizaris also lost 
Kafarlatha, a lesser locality in the Jabal al-Summaq, to Tancred. 
By 11 11, the position of the Nizaris had become rather untenable in 
Aleppo, where the local majority Imami Shi'i and Sunni populations 
had turned against them. Furthermore, a new Saljuq ruler in Persia, 
who was then pursuing a strong anti-Isma'ili policy, had begun to exert 
pressures on his Saljuq kin in Aleppo to adopt a similar stance against 
the local Nizaris. Nizari fortunes were irrevocably reversed in Aleppo 
when, in 1113, Ridwan's son and successor finally authorized a 
widespread anti-Nizari campaign in his domain. Abu Tahir and a 
group of some 200 leading Nizaris were arrested and executed; the 
popular outburst against the Nizaris in Aleppo culminated in a 
massacre. Nevertheless, many of the Aleppine Nizaris found refuge in 
the surrounding areas, including the Frankish territories, while smaller 
Nizari communities survived clandestinely in a few other towns and 
districts of northern Syria. 
In the aftermath of their debacle in Aleppo, the Nizaris were 
reorganized in Syria by their new leader, another Persian da'i called 
Bahram. During this second period, they moved the base of their 
operations to Damascus in southern Syria, where they acquired a 
significant following. By 1125, when Damascus was threatened by the 
Crusaders, the Nizaris were strong enough to send an armed contingent 
to fight in the company of the troops of Tughtigin, the Turkish ruler of 
Damascus, against the encroaching Franks. In 1126, Bahram demanded 
and was given by Tughtigin the fortress of Baniyas, situated on the 
border of the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem. Bahram fortified Baniyas 
and used it as his headquarters. Henceforth, Bahram preached Nizari 
doctrines openly in Damascus to the annoyance of the city's Sunni 
inhabitants. The Nizari ddis were now dispatched in all directions 
within Syria, where they won an increasing number of converts both in 
towns and rural areas. 
The Nizari success in southern Syria was also short-lived. In 1128, 
Bahram lost his life in a battle fought near Baniyas against a local Arab 
tribe, and in the same year the Nizaris witnessed the death of 
Tughtigin, their protector in Damascus. In 1129, Tughtigin's son and 
successor, Buri, sanctioned a general massacre of the Nizaris; some 
6000 perished at the hands of the town militia supported by the 
predominantly Sunni inhabitants of Damascus. It was shortly after 
these events that Bahram's successor, Isma'il al-Ajami, realizing the 

untenability of his position at Baniyas, wrote to King Baldwin I1 (1 11 8- 
31), who was then planning to advance on Damascus, and offered to 
surrender Baniyas to the Franks in exchange for receiving asylum.27 
Accompanied by some of his associates, the ddi Ismaeil found refuge 
in the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem where he died soon afterwards at the 
beginning of 1130. Buri himself was later killed in revenge by two 
Nizari fida'is who did not survive their act; but the Nizaris never 
recovered their position in Damascus and southern Syria. In the 
meantime, the rivalry between the Nizari and Musta'lian Ismaeilis had 
intensified, leading to the decisive victory of the Nizari cause in Syria. 
During this period, the early 1120s, the Fatimid caliph al-Amir had 
issued his anti-Nizari epistle, in which the Nizaris were for the first time 
referred to with the abusive designation of 'Hashishiyya'. Al-Amir, as 
noted, was assassinated by a group of fida'is in 1130; and soon 
Musta'lian Ismaeilism disappeared almost completely from Syria. 
During the first half of the twelfth century, there had also occurred 
numerous encounters between the Franks and the Fatimids. Al-Afdal, 
the all-powerful Fatimid vizier who had originally underestimated the 
threat of the Crusaders, had early entered in vain into negotiations with 
them. As has been noted, the Crusaders had easily seized Jerusalem 
from the Fatimids, also defeating a Fatimid army sent against them 
under the command of al-Afdal himself. Al-Afdal's subsequent attempts 
to deal more effectively with the Crusaders had all proved unsuccessful. 
By 1124, when Tyre was lost to the Crusaders, only Ascalon remained 
of the former Fatimid possessions in the Levant; and that last Fatimid 
coastal outpost, too, was lost in 1153. Meanwhile, in 11 17, Egypt itself 
had been temporarily invaded by King Baldwin I. By 1121, when al- 
Afdal was murdered at the instigation of the caliph al-Amir, the 
reputation of the Nizari assassinations had already become so wide- 
spread that this one, too, was readily attributed to them, especially 
because al-Afdal who had deprived Nizar of his succession rights in 
1094 had been generally considered as the arch-enemy of the Nizaris. 
In the final decades of the collapsing Fatimid regime, there were 
further military entanglements between the Crusaders and the Fatimids. 
King Amalric I of Jerusalem, who had his own designs for annexing the 
Fatimid dominions to the Latin kingdom in rivalry with the Zangids of 
Aleppo, led three expeditions into Egypt during the 1160s, reducing 
Fatimid Egypt to a virtual Frankish 
It was also in these 
closing years of the Fatimid caliphate that Amalric sent in 1167 an 
embassy to the last Fatimid caliph al-Adid (1160-71) and successfully 
imposed a treaty on him to receive a substantial annual tribute from the 
Fatimid treasury. The Frankish knights of this delegation, headed by 

Mediaeval European Perceptions of Islam and the Ismacilis 67 
Hugh of Caesarea, were greatly impressed by the splendour and 
ceremony of the Fatimid court.29 
Meanwhile, the Syrian Nizari Isma'ilis during a third period of their 
early history, lasting some two decades after their debacle of 1129 in 
Damascus, had finally succeeded in acquiring a network of mountain 
fortresses in the southern part of the Jabal Bahra (modern-day Jabal 
Ansariyya). The Franks had earlier attempted unsuccessfully to estab- 
lish themselves in the same area. In 1133, the Syrian Nizaris purchased 
their first fortress, Qadmus, from a Muslim lord who had recovered the 
place from the Franks in the previous year. In 1137, the Frankish 
garrison of the fortress of Khariba was dislodged by the local Nizaris. 
In 1140, the Nizaris captured Masyaf, their most important stronghold 
in Syria which then normally served as the headquarters of the chief 
da'i of the Syrian Nizaris. Around the same time, the Nizaris acquired 
Kahf and a few other fortresses in the Jabal Bahra, in proximity to the 
Frankish territories of Antioch and Tripoli. The Syrian Nizaris were to 
have numerous entanglements in this region with the Franks, especially 
with the Hospitallers who in 1142 received from the lord of Tripoli a 
large fortress situated at the southern end of the Jabal Bahra; it became 
known as the Krak des Chevaliers. 
The history and external relations of the Syrian Nizaris during the 
period when they were consolidating their position in the Jabal Bahra 
remain obscure. However, it is known that a group of Nizaris led by a 
certain Ali b. Wafa cooperated with Raymond of Antioch in his 
campaign against the Zangid ruler of Aleppo, who had also aroused the 
enmity of the Isma'ilis by his antiShi'i persecutions. Both Raymond 
and Ali lost their lives on the battlefield at Inab in 1149." A few years 
later, in 1152, a band of fida'is assassinated count Raymond I1 of 
Tripoli at the gates of his city; Ralph of Merle and another knight who 
were with the count and tried to save him, also perihed.' 
The motives 
behind the assassination of Raymond 11, the first Frankish victim of the 
Syrian Nizaris, were never revealed. King Baldwin I11 of Jerusalem, who 
was then in Tripoli, was greatly distressed by this event and ordered a 
majestic funeral for his relative. In a frenzy of retaliation, the Franks 
then turned on the Muslims and massacred a large number, and the 
Templars invaded the nearby territory of the Syrian Nizaris forcing the 
sectarians to start paying them an annual tribute of some 2000 gold 
pieces. 
In the early 1160s, the Syrian Nizaris entered a new phase of their 
history under Rashid al-Din Sinan, their greatest leader and the original 
'Old Man of the Mountain' of the Crusaders. Sinan fortified the Nizari 
castles, consolidated the position of the Syrian Nizari community, and 

also adopted suitable policies towards the Franks and the surrounding 
Muslim powers, always aiming to safeguard the security and indepen- 
dence of his community. He also reorganized the corps of the Nizari 
fidu'is, who were utilized most effectively in the realization of his 
objectives. 
By the time Sinan succeeded to the leadership of the Syrian Nizaris, 
the Franks of Tripoli and Antioch had had intermittent border clashes 
with the Nizaris for several decades. These entanglements began to be 
accentuated from the late 1160s, when King Amalric I of Jerusalem, 
who had increasingly come to rely on the services of the Templars and 
Hospitallers, ceded to them a large number of fortresses and their 
surrounding lands. Meanwhile, the Nizaris had continued to pay an 
annual tribute to the Templars, who now controlled Tortosa and 
almost all of its northern districts. This period also witnessed the rise of 
Saladin who, as the champion of Muslim unity, soon came to pose the 
greatest threat to the survival of the Syrian Nizari community, 
especially after he overthrew the Fatimids and asserted his indepen- 
dence from the Zangids. 
It was under these circumstances that Sinan attempted to establish 
peaceful relations with his Christian Frankish neighbours through 
negotiations with King Amalric I. As a culmination of these diplomatic 
efforts, in 1173, Sinan sent an ambassador called Boabdelle (Abd 
Allah) to Amalric seeking a formal rapprochement with the Latin 
kingdom and expecting to be relieved from the heavy tribute which the 
Nizaris then paid to the Templars. The Nizari envoy had evidently 
received a positive response from Amalric, who had promised to send 
an ambassador of his own to the Nizari leader and to have the tribute 
cancelled in the near future. However, the Templars, who were 
naturally displeased by these overtures, had Sinan's emissary assassi- 
nated on his return journey by one of their knights, Walter of Mesnil. 
King Arnalric was greatly angered by this assassination, which had been 
ordered by Odo of St Amand, the Grand Master of the Templars 
during 1171-9, and who had then refused to punish the culprit. 
Amalric personally led a force to Sidon, where he arrested Walter in the 
Templars' lodge and sent him to prison in Tyre; Amalric also conveyed 
his apologies to Sinan. William of Tyre further relates that it was at the 
time of this embassy that Sinan had informed Amalric that he and his 
community intended to embrace Christianity, for which reason they 
would expect the king to send them some Christian teachers.32 William 
of Tyre had obviously misunderstood the nature of Sinan's genuine 
desire for improved relations with the Christian Franks. At any rate, as . 
Amalric died in 1174, the negotiations between the Nizari leader and 

Mediaeval European Perceptions of Islam and the Ismdilis 
the king of Jerusalem proved abomve. Soon afterwards, the Nizari 
fida'is made several unsuccessful attempts on the life of Saladin, who 
was then extending his hegemony over Syria; but later, lasting peace 
was established also between Sinan and the Ayyubid sultan. 
It was also during the second half of the twelfth century that 
occidental travellers and chroniclers began to collect some fragmentary 
details and to write about the Nizari Isma'ilis. Benjamin of Tudela, the 
Spanish rabbi who was in the Near East during 1166-71, is probably 
the first European traveller to have left an account of them. Passing 
through Syria in 1167, Benjamin noted that there existed a people in 
the region called Hashishin, who had their principal seat at Qadmus 
and were a source of terror to their neighbours, killing even kings at the 
cost of their own lives. It is interesting to note that Rabbi Benjamin, 
who relates so many details on the Jewish communities of the Levant, 
failed to realize that the Syrian sectarians he was describing were 
actually Muslims. He states that these people 
do not believe in the religion of Islam, but follow one of their own 
folk, whom they regard as their prophet, and all that he tells them 
to do they carry out, whether for death or life. They call him the 
Sheikh A1 Hashishin, and he is known as their Elder. At his word 
these mountaineers go out and come in.33 
Like other Westerners, Benjamin was clearly impressed by the 
obedience of these sectarians towards their chief. He was also the first 
European traveller to refer to the Nizari Isma'ilis of Persia, with some 
awareness of the connection between the Persian Nizaris and their co- 
religionists in Syria. He relates that in northern Persia, in the land of 
Mulahid, obviously a corruption of the Arabic mulhid (plural, 
malahida), there 'live a people who do not profess the Mohammedan 
religion, but live on high mountains, and worship the Old Man of the 
land of the Hahishin'.Another early European account of the Syrian Nizaris is to be found 
in the diplomatic report of Burchard of Strassburg, an envoy of 
Frederick I Barbarossa (1152-90), the Hohenstaufen emperor of 
Germany who later organized a Crusade of his own and died en route 
to the Holy Land in 1190. Emperor Frederick had also engaged in some 
diplomatic negotiations with Saladin. In 1173, the Ayyubid sultan had 
sent a delegation to Frederick in Germany to win the friendship of this 
most powerful Christian sovereign. At Strassburg, Saladin's envoys had 
met the vice-dominus Burchard, an associate of the city's bishop. Soon 

The Assassin Legena3 
afterwards, when Frederick decided to reciprocate, he dispatched 
Burchard as his own envoy to Saladir.' 
Burchard arrived for a short stay in Syria towards the end of 1175, 
soon after the first Nizari attempt on Saladin's life and the failure of the 
negotiations between Sinan and Amalric 1. Burchard's account of the 
Nizaris, included in his subsequent report to Frederick Barbarossa, has 
been preserved in the Chronicle of Arnold ofi i b e c k .Burchard relates that 
on the confines of Damascus, Antioch and Aleppo there is a 
certain race of Saracens in the mountains, who in their own 
vernacular are called Heyssessini, and in Roman segnors de 
montanu. This race of men live without law; they eat pork against 
the law of Saracens . . . They dwell in the mountains and are quasi 
impregnable, because they withdraw into fortified castles. Their 
country is not very fertile, so they live on their cattle. They have 
among them a lord, who inspires the greatest fear in the Saracen 
princes near and far, and also in the neighbouring Christian lords; 
because he has an astonishing mode of killing them?' 
Burchard concludes his narrative with a story about the training of 
the would-be fida'is, which is probably the oldest written version of the 
Assassin legends designed to provide some explanation for the obedient 
behaviour of the Nizari fida'is. Burchard does not mention his sources; 
but he seems to have acquired his information orally and from the 
Crusader and Christian circles in the Levant. 
William of Tyre is the earliest Crusader historian who a few years 
later, around 1180, produced his own brief description of the Syrian 
Nizaris and incorporated it into his Chronicle just before discussing 
Sinan's 1173 mission to King Amalri.* 
In the province of Tyre in Phoenicia and in the diocese of Tortosa 
there lives [William says,] a tribe of people who possess ten 
fortresses with the villages attached to them. Their number, as we 
have often heard, is about sixty thousand or possibly more. It is 
the custom of this people to choose their ruler, not by hereditary 
right, but by the prerogative of merit. This chief, when elected, 
they call the Old Man [Senem], disdaining a more dignified title. 
Their subjection and obedience to him is such they regard nothing 
as too harsh or difficult and eagerly undertake even the most 
dangerous tasks at his command. For instance, if there happens to 
be a prince who has incurred the hatred or distrust of this people, 

Mediaeval European Perceptions of Islam and the Isma'ilis 
the chief places a dagger in the hand of one or several of his 
followers; those thus designated hasten away at once, regardless 
of the consequences of the deed or the probability of personal 
escape. Zealously they labor for as long as may be necessary, until 
at last the favorable chance comes which enables them to carry 
out the mandate of the chief. Neither Christians nor Saracens 
know whence this name, the Assassins [Assissini], is derived. 
It is interesting to note that, unlike Burchard, the well-informed 
William, who was equally impressed by the obedience of the sectarians, 
did not seek to provide any particular explanation for the unwavering 
loyalty of the Old Man's followers; and, consequently, he did not 
contribute to the formation of the Assassin legends which had then 
begun to appear in Crusader circles. 
William of Tyre further notes that for about four centuries these 
people had zealously followed the law and customs of the Saracens, but 
that recently their chief had experienced a change of heart. Somehow he 
had come to possess the Christian books of the gospels and the 
apostolic law, which he read with interest and began to understand the 
Christian doctrine. As a result, he turned away from his religion and 
instructed his people to stop observing the practices and superstitions 
of that cult, also allowing the use of wine and pork. Finally he sent an 
ambassador to our king [Amalric], announcing that he and his 
community were collectively prepared to embrace Christianity. 
These statements reflect an erroneous interpretation of what William 
of Tyre must have heard locally about certain beliefs and practices of 
the Syrian Nizari Isma'ilis. A learned Isma'ili leader, Sinan was also 
interested in establishing peaceful relations with his Christian and 
Sunni neighbours; as such, he must have displayed an ecumenical 
outlook which was in line with the general cyclical view of the Isma'ilis 
regarding the religious history of mankind. According to this view, the 
Isma'ilis believed in the common, eternal truths of all revelations, 
including those embodied in Judaism, Christianity and Islam, though 
all earlier religions had been superseded by Islam. Consequently, Jesus 
had been accorded an important place in Isma'ili thought as the 
enunciator (natiq) of the fifth era (dawr) of hierohistory, the era of 
Christianity. Like other highly educated Isma'ili ddis, Sinan had 
indeed, as William relates, familiarized himself with some of the sacred 
scriptures of Christianity. But William evidently misunderstood these 
facts, which he combined with other confused rumours and reports 
about the alleged libertine practices of the sectarians; reports which he, 
like Burchard before him, must have heard locally in relation to the 

declaration of the qiyama in the Syrian Nizari community. This 
declaration, occurring in the mid-1160s, had been misunderstood, as 
noted, even by some of the Syrian Nizaris themselves. Some Syrian 
Muslim sources, too, relate details about the libertine practices of the 
dissidents in question who had gone astray.39 At any rate, William of 
Tyre did not fantasize at all about the secret practices of the Syrian 
Nizari chief and his devoted fida'is. This field soon began to be tackled 
by other much less informed occidental observers. 
In 1187, Jerusalem and most of the other Frankish towns and castles 
of Outremer were seized by Saladin, who also captured a good number 
of Crusader princes and knights. In fact, Guy of Lusignan, then king of 
Jerusalem by virtue of his marriage to Amalric 1's daughter Sibylla, and 
the Grand Masters of the knights Templar and Hospitaller spent a year 
in captivity before they were released by Saladin under the terms of a 
peace agreement. By 1189, only Tyre, saved by the efforts of Conrad of 
Montferrat, as well as Antioch and Tripoli were still in the hands of the 
Franks. It was under such circumstances that the Third Crusade was led 
to the Holy Land by Philip I1 Augustus (118C1223) and Richard I the 
Lionheart (1189-99). The kings of France and England were also 
joined by their common nephew, count Henry of Champagne, the most 
powerful baron of France whose mother was half-sister to both kings. 
This new Crusade succeeded in July 1191 in seizing Acre, which now 
served as the capital of the restored kingdom of Jerusalem. 
The Crusaders had always had their own internal rivalries and 
disputes. Marquis Conrad of Montferrat, who had played a significant 
part in the overall success of the Third Crusade (1189-92), had 
refrained from recognizing the claim of Guy of Lusignan to the throne 
of Jerusalem; and Guy's position was made even more difficult by the 
death of his wife Sibylla in October 1190. At any rate, Conrad 
developed his own claim to the throne of the Latin kingdom when he 
married Isabella, King Amalric's other daughter and Sibylla's sister, in 
November 1190. In April 1192, the claim of Conrad, who had 
meanwhile styled himself king-elect of Jerusalem and had entered into 
negotiations of his own with Saladin, was officially acknowledged by 
King Richard who was still in Outremer and by the leading Frankish 
dignitaries of Jerusalem. Thereupon, preparations got under way in 
Acre for the coronation of Conrad, who then resided in Tyre. A few 
days later, however, on 28 April 1192, Conrad of Montferrat fell 
victim in a narrow street of Tyre to the daggers of two assassins who 
had disguised themselves as Christian monks. 
Most sources agree that Conrad's two assassins, who had waited for 
about six months before they finally found the opportunity to carry out 

Mediaeval European Perceptions of Islam and the Isma'ilis 
their mission, were Nizari fida'is sent by Sinan. There is, however, 
much controversy regarding the instigator of this assassination. Many 
Muslim sources as well as some European (especially French) ones state 
that Richard, King of England, who then had a quarrel with the 
marquis, had arranged the murder. In fact, when Richard was later 
briefly imprisoned in Austria, this charge was brought against him; but 
he denied the allegations and was released on payment of a ransom. 
Nevertheless, English writers felt it necessary to invent two letters 
supposedly written by the Old Man of the Mountain, one addressed to 
Leopold of Austria and the other to all the princes of Europe, which 
cleared Richard of any involvement in Conrad's assasination.On the 
other hand, Ibn al-Athir, the famous Muslim historian who disliked 
Saladin, reports that it was the Ayyubid sultan who had commissioned 
Sinan to have both Conrad and Richard killed;41 but in the event 
Richard's assassination had proved impossible. Finally, a late Syrian 
Isma'ili source attributes the initiative to Sinan himself.42 
It is interesting to note that certain European sources, drawing on the 
views of the contemporary barons in Outremer, do actually provide 
some explanation for the Nizari leader's enmity towards Conrad. 
According to these sources, Conrad had offended Sinan by seizing a 
ship laden with a rich cargo belonging to the Syrian Nizaris, and had 
then refused to return the goods or the crew who were brutally 
drowned. 
At any rate, the murder of Conrad of Montferrat greatly impressed 
Frankish circles and came to be discussed, usually with some notes on 
the 'Assassins', by most of the occidental historians of the Third 
Crusade.43 The narrative of Arnold of Liibeck is of particular 
significance in terms of the Assassin legends; and, as we shall see later; 
it seems to be the earliest occidental source referring to an intoxicating 
potion administered by the Old Man to the would-be Nizari fida'is. 
Henceforth, several European monarchs, such as Richard I who was 
charged with plotting against King Philip Augustus of France, were 
periodically accused of being in league with the 'Assassins' of the Latin 
East, or of having adopted the Old Man's methods of dealing with his 
enemies; all attesting to the widespread fame of the Nizaris and their 
methods of struggle in mediaeval Europe."4 As the fame of the Old 
Man and the self-sacrificing behaviour of his fida'is began to circulate 
more widely, the nascent legends of the 'Assassins', too, began to take 
more imaginative and wilder forms. 
A few days after Conrad's death, his widow Isabella married Henry 
of Champagne, who had been favoured by King Richard I and the 
Frankish barons to succeed to the throne of Jerusalem; Henry became 

the ruler of the Latin kingdom from the time of this marriage in May 
1192 until his death in 1197. In September 1192, a peace treaty was 
finally signed between Richard and Saladin, who had been engaged in 
negotiations for some time; and, at Saladin's request, the Franks also 
agreed to extend the peace terms to the Nizari territories in Syria. Soon 
afterwards, in 1192 or a year later, Sinan, who had led the Syrian 
Nizaris during a 30-year period to the peak of their power and fame, 
died at the castle of Kahf. Saladin's death occurred in 1193; and King 
Richard 1 of England finally set sail from Acre in October 1192, 
marking the end of the Third Crusade which had succeeded in re- 
establishing the kingdom of Jerusalem. With these events, an era in the 
complex relationships between the Syrian Nizaris, the Crusaders, and 
the founder of the Ayyubid state, sultan Saladin, had also come to an 
end. 
Soon after Saladin's death, the Latins of Antioch became involved in 
frontier disputes with Cilician Armenia; there had also developed some 
deep racial and religious conflicts between the larger Greek and 
Armenian populations of the principality. As a result, Bohemond 111 
(1163-1201), prince of Antioch, and Leon I1 (1187-98), Roupenid 
prince of Armenia, were soon engaged in open hostilities. On 
Bohemond's request, Henry of Champagne, who had now asserted 
some degree, of hegemony over Antioch, decided to intervene in this 
internecine dispute which could lead to the fall of the northern 
principality into Armenian hands. Occidental sources relate that, in the 
spring of 1194, while en route to Antioch, or perhaps on the return 
journey to Acre, Henry passed through the territory of the Nizaris and 
was met by the ambassadors of the new Old Man of the Mountain who 
had then recently succeeded Sinan in the leadership of the 'Assassins'. 
On the invitation of the Old Man, who was eager to maintain a truce 
with the Franks in the aftermath of Conrad of Montferrat's assassina- 
tion and of Saladin's peace treaty, Henry did visit the castle of Kahf, 
where he was entertained lavishly and was given valuable gifts by the 
Nizari chief, actually a Perisan da'i called Nasr or Abu Mansur. In 
connection with this visit, a number of occidental sources, starting with 
the continuations of William of Tyre;' 
related variants of a story about 
the death leaps of the Nizari fida'is at the command of their chief; a 
demonstration supposedly designed to impress the Frankish king with 
the loyalty of the sectarians. 
Sinan's successors as leaders of the Syrian Nizari community 
continued to exercise a certain degree of local initiative in their dealings 
with the Franks, though none of them achieved Sinan's relative 
independence from Alamut. The Nizaris now had friendly relations 

Mediaeval European Perceptions of lshm and the lsmaeilis 75 
with Saladin's Ayyubid successors in Syria, while they continued to 
maintain their complex contacts and conflicts with the Crusaders and 
the military orders, some of which remain shrouded in obscurity. For 
instance, Raymond, son of Bohemond IV of Antioch, was killed in 
1213 in the church of Tortosa, reportedly by some Nizari fida'is. And 
when in the following year Bohemond in an act of revenge laid siege to 
the Nizari fortress of Khawabi, the Nizaris received timely help from 
the Ayyubid rulers of Aleppo and Damascus, compelling the Franks to 
retreat. The circumstances surrounding Raymond's assassination 
remain unknown, though this act was probably rooted in hostility 
towards Bohemond himself. In this connection, it may be mentioned in 
passing that Bohemond's behaviour had also made him unpopular in 
Crusader circles and among the Latins of Antioch; he was even 
excommunicated in 1208 by patriarch Albert of Jerusalem under orders 
from Pope Innocent I11 (1198-1216). In an official report sent from 
Acre to Pope Innocent 111 earlier in 1204, this same patriarch Albert 
had spoken of the great fear inspired in Christians and Muslims alike 
by the chief of the Nizaris due to the murders committed by his 
A s ai s .Bohemond had also aroused the enmity of the military orders; 
in 1230 the Syrian Nizaris actually helped the Hospitallers in their 
military campaign against him. It is, therefore, not unlikely that the 
Hospitallers themselves may have instigated the assassination of 
Bohemond's youthful son. 
Meanwhile, the Syrian Nizaris had somehow managed to receive 
tributes frGm some Christian rulers. In 1227, Frederick I1 (1211-SO), 
Hohenstaufen emperor of Germany who led his own Crusade (1228-9) 
to the Holy Land, sent an embassy to the Syrian Nizari chief, Majd al- 
Din. The ambassadors of Frederick, who was then also the titular king 
of Jerusalem by virtue of his marriage to the heiress of the Latin 
kingdom, a granddaughter of Conrad of Montferrat and Isabella, had 
brought with them splendid gifts worth 80,000 dinars. Frederick 
himself arrived in Acre in 1228 and gained possession of Jerusalem and 
other localities for the Franks for a ten-year period (1229-39) under 
the terms of a truce signed with the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt. Emperor 
Frederick, too, had his own differences with papal policies, which 
resulted in his excommunication by Pope Gregory IX (122741); and 
his rapprochement with the Syrian Nizaris met with the disapproval of 
the Hospitallers, who were then attempting to make the sectarians their 
own tributaries. As the Nizaris refused to comply with the demands of 
the Hospitallers, the knights of that military order led a force into the 
Syrian Nizari territory and carried off much booty. By 1228, the Syrian 
Nizaris had in fact become tributaries to the Hospitallers under the 

terms of a cooperative pact, while they continued to pay tribute to the 
Templars. It was also around this time that the Nizaris began to'lend 
occasional support to the military orders in their campaigns against 
some of the Christian rulers of the Latin states; and at least the 
Hospitallers reciprocated by defending the Nizaris against the 
encroaching forces of Antioch and Tripoli. The Nizari involvement in 
the Hospitaller campaign of 1230 launched from Krak des Chevaliers 
against Bohemond IV of Antioch represented one such instance of 
cooperation. 
It was against this background that Bohemond V (1233-57), the 
next prince of Antioch and Raymond's brother, wrote to Pope Gregory 
IX complaining that the Grand Master of the Hospitallers was then in 
league with the 'Assassins'. In response to this complaint, on 26 August 
1236, Pope Gregory wrote to the Archbishop of Tyre and the bishops 
of Sidon and Beirut insisting that the Hospitallers should terminate any 
compromising connections with 
the Assassins, the enemies of God and of the Christian name, who 
formerly dared to slay treacherously Raymond [son of Bohemond 
I V  . . . and many other magnates and Catholic princes, and are 
striving to overcome our faith by force . . . and what is far graver 
still the aforesaid Assassins, on account of the promise made by 
the aforementioned Master and brethren [of the Hospital] to 
support and protect them from Christian attacks, have under- 
taken to pay them a certain sum of money every year. Therefore 
we have sent them orders in writing to desist from defending these 
same Assassins . . . And so we now charge you that if the said 
Master and brethren should fail to observe this our command, 
you shall compel them to abandon this understanding by the 
censures of the Church, without right of appeal, after giving them 
due warning.47 
A similar papal letter was evidently issued regarding the connections 
that possibly existed at the time between the Templars and the 
'Assassins'. 
Thus, contacts had continued to increase between the Crusaders and 
the Syrian Nizaris. Under such circumstances, it would not have been 
too difficult for the Franks to acquire more accurate knowledge about 
the Nizari Ismaeilis who, by the end of the twelfth century, had 
attracted so much public attention in Outremer, both in Crusader 
circles as well as among the oriental Christians of the region. But 
proximity to the Syrian Nizaris did not result in more accurate 

Mediaeval European Perceptions of Islam and the Isma'ilis 
perceptions of the Nizari beliefs and practices; and the Crusader 
historians of the first half of the thirteenth century added practically 
nothing to the limited and distorted knowledge of the sect then 
possessed by Europeans. This becomes abundantly clear by analysing 
what James of Vitry, the most learned Frankish writer of the period, 
had to say on the subject. 
James (Jacques) of Vitry was a cleric from Paris and an ardent 
preacher and supporter of the Crusading movement throughout his 
career. He preached the Crusade even before he was appointed, in 
1216, Bishop of Acre by Pope Honorius I11 (1216-27); and he sus- 
tained his missionary activities during his ministry at Acre (1216-28), 
and after returning to Europe as the cardinal-bishop of Tusuculum. 
James also participated actively in the Fifth Crusade (1217-21), for 
which he campaigned vigorously. Indeed, he had been of the opinion 
that the Saracens, who had hitherto refrained from converting to 
Christianity because they feared the vengeance of their co-religionists, 
would readily convert once the Crusaders had arrived on the scene.48 
James was also the first Catholic in the Crusaders' times to have 
preached earnestly to the Muslims of the Levant. He travelled widely in 
Syria, delivering sermons to large gatherings in Christian towns and 
castles; he also preached in the Christian-Muslim borderland and sent 
numerous letters in Arabic to the Muslims living beyond the border 
areas.49 In the course of the Fifth Crusade, James succeeded in different 
ways in obtaining control over large numbers of Muslim children who 
had been held as captives by the Crusaders, baptizing them and 
ensuring their Christian education. However, he soon realized how 
difficult it was to detach the Muslims from their religious background, 
necessitating some moderation of his earlier missionary zeal. 
James of Vitry was perhaps the best informed occidental observer of 
Muslim affairs in Outremer after William of Tyre, although he 
remained extremely hostile towards Islam and does not seem to have 
made any special effort to learn about it. It is, therefore, not surprising 
that his description of the Nizari IsmaTlis is based almost entirely on 
that of William of Tyre. The only new factual detail he added related to 
the inter-connection between the Syrian and Persian Nizari Ima'ilis.In the province of Phoenicia, near the borders of the Antaraden- 
sian town which is now called Tortosa, dwells a certain people, 
shut in on all sides by rocks and mountains, who have ten castles, 
very strong and impregnable, by reason of the narrow ways and 
inaccessible rocks, with their suburbs and the valleys, which are 
most fruitful in all species of fruits and corn, and most delightful 

for their amenity. The number of these men, who are called 
Assassins [Assasini], is said to exceed 40,000. They set a captain 
over themselves, not by hereditary succession, but by the 
prerogative of merit, whom they call the Old Man (Vetwem seu 
Senem), not so much on account of his advanced age as for his 
pre-eminence in prudence and dignity. The first and principal 
abbot of this unhappy religion of theirs, and the place where they 
had their origin and whence they came to Syria, is in the very 
remote parts of the east, near the city of Bagdad and the parts of 
the province of Persia. These people, who do not divide the hoof, 
nor make a difference between what is sacred and what is 
profane, believe that all obedience indifferently shown by them 
towards their superior is meritorious for eternal life. Hence they 
are bound to their master, whom they call the Old Man, with such 
a bond of subjection and obedience that there is nothing so 
difficult or so dangerous that they would fear to undertake, or 
which they would not perform with a cheerful mind and ardent 
will, at the command of their lord. 
After offering his own version of how the Nizari fida'is were trained 
by the Old Man, which will be considered in the next chapter, James 
concluded his account by stating that the 'As'sassins' 
kept the law of Mahomet and his institutions diligently and 
straitly beyond all other Saracens till the times of a certain master 
of theirs, who, being endowed with natural genius, and exercised 
in the study of different writings, began with all diligence to read 
and examine the law of the Christians and the Gospels of Christ, 
admiring the virtue of the miracles, and the sanctity of the 
doctrine. From a comparison with these he began to abominate 
the frivolous and irrational doctrine of Mahomet, and at length, 
when he knew the truth, he studied to recall his subjects by 
degrees from the rites of the cursed law. Wherefore he exhorted 
and commanded them that they should drink wine in moderation 
and eat the flesh of swine. At length, after many discourses and 
serious admonitions of their teacher, they all with one consent 
agreed to renounce the perfidy of Mahomet, and, by receiving the 
grace of baptism, to become Christians. 
Clearly, James of Vitry, like William of Tyre, had been grossly misled 
by confused rumours about the Nizari doctrine of the qiyama, which he 

Mediaeval European Perceptions of Islam and the Isma'ilis 
further confounded with some misinformation about Sinan's reported 
desire to establish peaceful relations with the Franks of Outremer. 
The last important encounter between the Franks and the Nizari 
Isma'ilis, prior to the loss of political power by the sect in Syria, 
occurred in connection with the diplomatic designs of King Louis IX 
(1226-70). Following the early defeat of his Crusade, which repre- 
sented the culmination of the efforts of Christendom to recover the 
Holy Places, Louis IX (St Louis) ransomed himself from captivity in 
Egypt and settled down in Acre for four years (1250-54). While in Acre 
he exchanged embassies and gifts with the leader of the Syrian Nizari 
community, also obtaining some information about their beliefs. We 
have a detailed account of these events from the pen of the famous 
French chronicler John, lord of Joinville (Jean de Joinville), whose 
family had been in the service of the counts of Champagne. Joinville 
accompanied the French king on his Crusade and then stayed with him 
in Acre as a close companion and secretary. Joinville returned with St 
Louis to France in 1254, but later declined to accompany him on his 
Tunisian Crusade of 1270, which turned out to be even more 
catastrophic than the king's expedition to Egypt. In France, Joinville 
(d. 1317) produced a most valuable History of Saint Louis, with special 
reference to the unhappy events of the king's earlier Crusade and his 
dealings in Outremer. 
Referring to the Nizari Isma'ilis as the Assacis and also as the 
Bedouins, Joinville relates that during the king's residence at Acre, 
probably in 1250-51, 'there came likewise to him ambassadors from 
the prince of the Bedouins, called the Old Man of the Mountain . . . 
asking the king if he were acquainted with their lord . . . The king said 
he was not; he had never seen him, although he had heard much 
spoken of him.' The ambassadors then told the king that he should 
start paying tribute to their chief 'in like manner as the emperor of 
Germany, the king of Hungary, the sultan of Babylon [Egypt], and 
many other princes, have yearly done; for they know well, that they 
would not be allowed to exist or reign, but during his good pleasure.' 
The emissaries also declared, Joinville adds, that their chief would be 
equally satisfied if the king were to acquit him of the tribute he then 
paid annually to the Grand Master of the Temple, or of theosital." 
Joinville then relates how the king promised to deliver his reply in a 
second meeting, which was convened later on the same day in the 
presence of the Grand Masters of the Templars and Hospitallers; but 
instead of keeping his promise, the emissaries were now pressured by 
the Grand Masters, Reginald of Vichier and William of Chateauneuf, 
into repeating their earlier request. Joinville explains that in the course 

of a third meeting which took place on the following day, the Grand 
Masters reprimanded the Nizari emissaries for having conveyed such an 
imprudent message to the King of France, and they enjoined the 
emissaries to return to their chief and 'to come back within fifteen days 
with such letters from [their] prince, that the king shall be contented 
with him'. According to Joinville, who may have been present at some 
of these meetings, the Nizari envoys returned to Acre within the 
specified period, bringing valuable gifts from their chief, including a 
crystal elephant, several amber statues and other ornaments inlaid with 
gold, as well as a shirt and a ring. In connection with the last two items, 
the envoys reportedly told the king: 
Sire, we are come back from our lord, who informs you that as 
the shirt is the part of dress nearest to the body, he sends you this, 
his shirt, as a gift, or a symbol that you are the king for whom he 
has the greatest affection, and which he is most desirous to 
cultivate; and, for a fuqher assurance of it, here is his ring that he 
sends you, which is of pure gold, and hath his name engraven on 
it; and with this ring our lord espouses you, and understands that 
henceforth you be as one of the fingers of his hand. 
Desiring to cultivate friendly relations with the Nizari Isma'ilis, St 
Louis responded to their peace initiative by dispatching his own gift- 
bearing ambassadors to the Old Man of the Mountain. This Frankish 
mission also included an Arabic-speaking friar, Yves the Breton, who 
had conducted other negotiations with Muslim rulers on behalf of the 
French king. It was in the course of his meetings with the Nizari chief, 
held at the stronghold of Masyaf, that Yves evidently conversed with 
the 'prince of the Bedouins' on 'the articles of his faith'. Joinville 
recounts interesting details of what Yves the Breton later reported to 
the king regarding his understanding of the doctrines preached by the 
Nizarisma'ilis.The Old Man of the Mountain, Friar Yves had reported, 
did not believe in Mahomet, but followed the religion of Aly, who 
was . . . the uncle of Mahomet . . . it was Aly to whom Mahomet 
was indebted for all the honours he enjoyed; and that, when 
Mahomet had made his great conquests over mankind, he 
quarrelled with and separated from Aly, who perceiving the pride 
of Mahomet, and that he wished to trample upon him, began to 
draw as many as he could to his doctrines, and retired to a part of 
the deserts and mountains of Egypt, where he gave them a 

Mediaeval European Perceptions of Islam and the Ismacilis 81 
different creed from that of Mahomet. Those who support the 
religion of Aly call those who follow Mahomet unbelievers, as the 
Mahometans in like manner style the Bedouins infidels. Each 
party, in this respect, says the truth, for in fact they are both 
unbelievers. 
Joinville has preserved other, equally confused and misunderstood, 
details of what Yves had to say on some of the more specific tenets 
attributed to the Nizaris. 'One of the points of the doctrine of Aly', 
Yves had reported, 'consists in the belief, that when any one is killed by 
the command or in the service of his superior, the soul of the person so 
killed goes into another body of higher rank, and enjoys more comforts 
than before'. Yves cited this alleged Nizari belief in the transmigration 
of souls as the main reason why the Nizari fida'is were so eager to be 
killed in the service of their chief. Having misunderstood the Isma'ili 
cyclical view of history, however, Yves had also misrepresented an 
incomplete version of this view in terms of the transmigration of the 
souls of prophets and their legatees. In this connection, Yves had 
evidently found, in the living quarters of the Old Man, a short 
Christian treatise which contained some sayings of Jesus addressed to 
St Peter. Delighted at this evidence of interest in Christianity, Yves had 
then told the Nizari chief to read that book frequently, 'for, small as it 
may be, it contains many excellent things'. The Old Man had 
reportedly replied that he did in fact read it frequently, adding that he 
held St Peter in highest esteem, because 
in the beginning of the world, the soul of Abel, after his brother 
Cain had murdered him, entered the body of Noah; and the soul 
of Noah, on his decease, went into the body of Abraham; and 
after Abraham it entered the body of St Peter, who is now under 
the earth. 
Joinville himself included some information on the Nizaris in his 
History of Saint Louis, which follows closely the account of Yves the 
Bretn.'He, too, notes that the Bedouins (Nizaris) 
have no great faith in Mahomet, like the Turks, but believe in the 
religion of Aly . . . They are persuaded that when any one of them 
dies for the service of his lord, or when attempting any good 
design, his soul enters a superior body, and is much more 

comfortable than it was before; this makes them ready to die at 
the command of their superiors or elders. 
Joinville ends his note on the Syrian Nizaris by stating that 'their 
numbers are not to be counted; for they dwell in the kingdoms of 
Jerusalem, Egypt, and throughout all the lands of the Saracens and 
infidels'. 
It is significant that neither Joinville nor his source, Yves the Breton, 
who lived in the Latin East and had contacts with the Syrian Nizaris 
and their leadership, participated in the formation of the Assassin 
legends. In other words, they did not fantasize about the secret 
practices of the Nizaris, nor did they endorse any of the then circulating 
versions of such legends purporting to explain the devotion of the 
fida'is and their attachment to their chief. Joinville and Yves the Breton 
were, indeed, the only thirteenth-century occidental observers of the 
Nizaris who attempted to explain the devotion of the fida'is on the 
basis of the sectarian beliefs, while their contemporaries in Crusader 
circles and in Europe were already well embarked on their quest to 
rationalize the behaviour of the fida'is in terms of their addiction to 
bodily pleasures, induced with or without intoxicating potions. 
St Louis, as noted, also endeavoured to forge an alliance with the 
Mongols agiinst the Muslims; and for this purpose he sent William of 
Rubruck as his envoy to the Great Khan Mongke. William has several 
references to the Nizaris in his account of his mission to Mongolia. In 
addition to relating that a group of 'Assassins' had been sent under 
different guises to Karakorum to kill the Great Khan, William is among 
the earliest Europeans to have referred to the Persian Nizaris as the 
'Assassins'. 
William embarked on his journey to Mongolia in 1253. On passing 
north of the Caspian Sea in his itinerary, he notes that 'to its south it 
has the Caspian range and Persia, and to the east the mountains of the 
Mulihet (that is, thessassins)'.'And later, while reporting the 
dispatch of a large group of 'Assassins' to Karakoruw, William adds 
that the Great Khan 'has sent one of the uterine brothers into the 
territory of the Assassins, who are known to them as the Mulihet, with 
orders for their complete extermination'." In all probability, William 
had heard the term 'Assassins', or its variants such as 'Axasins' and 
'Hacsasins' which appear in other manuscripts of his itinerary, from the 
Crusaders and was to some extent aware, like James of Vitry, of the ties 
between the Syrian and the Persian Nizaris. William used the words 
Assassins and Mulihet (a corruption of the Arabic mulbid or malahida) 
interchangeably; in addition to applying the term 'Assassins' to both 

Mediaeval European Perceptions of Islam and the Isma'ilis 
the entire Persian Nizari community and the group of the Nizari 
fida'is. At any rate, William of Rubruck did not succeed in his 
diplomatic mission and returned to Europe in 1256. St Louis himself, 
having accomplished none of his designs for Christendom during his 
stay in Outremer, had returned to France a year earlier. Meanwhile, 
Mongke's own designs against the Muslim powers were carried out 
with catastrophic precision. 
By 1258, the Mongols had achieved their twin objectives of 
destroying the Nizari state in Persia and the Abbasid caliphate. The 
Mongol armies then advanced into Syria, where they had some initial 
successes before being decisively defeated in 1260, in Palestine, by the 
Mamluks who were now establishing their own rule over Egypt and 
Syria, in succession to the Ayyubids. 
The Syrian Nizari Isma'ilis were, thus, spared the horrific fate of 
their Persian co-religionists. But the extinction of the political power of 
the parent sect in Persia had dealt a devastating blow to the Syrian 
Nizaris who soon lost their own, now essentially fragile, independence. 
By 1267, the Syrian Nizaris had become tributaries to Baybars I (1260- 
77), the Mamluk sultan who expelled the Mongols from Syria and 
inflicted decisive defeats on the Crusaders. Meanwhile, as a result of a 
treaty signed between the Mamluk sultan and the Hospitallers, the 
latter had renounced the tribute which they themselves had hitherto 
received from the Nizaris. The Syrian Nizaris had now, in fact, placed 
themselves under the suzerainty of the Mamluk state; and by 1273 they 
had lost even their nominal independence. However, the Syrian Nizaris 
were allowed to remain in their fortresses in the Jabal Bahra under the 
stria surveillance of Mamluk lieutenants. The legendary accounts of 
the fida'is and their activities also continued to circulate, even though 
the Nizaris were now devoid of any political power and no longer had 
any prominent political enemies. There are also some scattered reports 
suggesting that Baybars and his successors in the Mamluk dynasty may 
have employed the services of the Syrian Nizaris against their own 
enemies. For instance, the assassination of Philip of Montford, lord of 
Tyre and an important baron of Jerusalem, in 1270, and the 
unsuccessful attempt on the life of Prince Edward of England in 1272, 
are reported to have been instigated by Baybars with the help of the 
Nizari fida'is. 
With the loss of their independence and political power, the Nizaris 
no longer played any important part in the political events of the Near 
East; and there no longer occurred any direct contact between them 
and the Franks. Under these conditions, the Franks learned nothing 
new about the Nizaris during the later Middle Ages, enabling the 

highly embellished and imaginative tales of Marco Polo and other 
Westerners to fall on fertile ground. Tales of the 'Assassins' now derived 
'legitimacy' or pseudo-historicity from the fanciful heritage of several 
generations. 
In sum, mediaeval Europeans learned very little about Islam and 
Muslims, and their less informed knowledge of the Isma'ilis found 
expression in a few superficial observations and erroneous perceptions 
scattered in Crusader histories and other occidental sources. Yet by the 
middle of the thirteenth century, many of these sources claimed to 
possess intricate details about the secret practices of the Isma'ilis and 
their chief, the Old Man of the Mountain; the Assassin legends had by 
then truly come into being.

Origins and Early Formation 
of the Legends 
The Isma'ilis organized a dynamic, revolutionary movement against 
the Abbasids who, like the Umayyads before them, had, in the eyes of 
the Shi'a, usurped the legitimate rights of the Alids to the leadership of 
the Muslim community. The Isma'ili da'wa or religio-political propa- 
ganda achieved its crowning success in 909 in the establishment of the 
Fatimid caliphate; the first Shi'i caliphate ruled by the Isma'ili imam 
from the progeny of Ali and the Prophet's daughter Fatima. 
The Isma'ilis, generally perceived as belonging to a single homo- 
genequs cohmunity, were targeted for a hostile literary campaign by 
different groups of Muslim writers. In time, the seminal anti-Isma'ili 
'black legend' came to be accepted by the Muslim majority as an 
accurate description of the motives, teachings and practices of the 
Isma'ilis. However, their political fortunes continued to rise and the 
movement survived the Nizari-Musta'li schism of 1094. The Nizari 
Isma'ilis were quick to retrieve the revolutionary zeal and ideals of the 
pre-Fatimid Isma'ilis; and they launched an armed revolt against the 
Sunni Saljuq Turks in Persia and Syria. Confronted by the overwhelm- 
ingly more superior and decentralized military power of the Saljuqs, the 
Nizari Isma'ilis also resorted to assassinating their prominent enemies 
in particular localities. This policy proved very effective, and before too 
long most political assassinations of any importance, at least in the 
central Muslim lands, were attributed to the daggers of the Nizari 
fida'is, who rarely survived their own missions. The eastern assassina- 
tions of the Alamut period, whether or not actually committed by the 
fida'is, played an important part in shaping anti-Nizari opinion in 
Muslim society. Hostile reports and misinformation about the alleged 
Nizari abrogation of the sharr'a further contributed to the Nizaris' 
negative image. 
In time, the reports of the assassinations attributed to the Nizaris also

caught the attention of the Crusaders and their historians. Westerners 
were particularly impressed by the self-sacrificing behaviour of the 
Nizari devotees. By the final decades of the twelfth century, the 
Crusaders and their occidental observers had already begun to resort to 
imagination in order to explain to their own satisfaction the motives 
behind the unwavering devotion of the fida'is belonging to the sect of 
the 'Assassins'. 
The Nizaris were also the target of the official wrath of the Sunni 
establishment, in addition to inheriting the defamations levelled against 
the earlier Isma'ilis. Mediaeval Muslim writers sometimes designated 
the Nizaris by religious terms such as the Batiniyya and the Talimiyya, 
when not referring to them as the Ismaciliyya, and theizariyya.' 
However, the Nizaris, like other Ismacilis, were more commonly 
designated as the 'Malahida' (or 'Mulhidun') by their Muslim enemies 
during the Alamut period and later, especially from the second half of 
the twelfth century. Much less frequently, the Nizaris were referred to 
by other abusive terms and expressions such as 'al-Hashishiyya', or 
'Jama'at al-Hashishiyya', which supposedly meant the community of 
hashish users. 
The earliest written application of the term hashishiyya to the 
Nizaris, representing the first known instance of its use in Islamic 
sources, occurs in the highly anti-Nizari polemical epistle issued around 
1123 by the Fatimid chancery in Cairo on behalf of the caliph al-Amir, 
who was then recognized as an imam by the Musta'lian Isma'ilis. As 
noted already, this epistle, the lqae sawaciq al-irgham, sent to the 
Musta'lians of Syria, was a second official attempt, after the earlier al- 
Hidaya al-Amiriyya, to refute the claims of Nizar, al-Amir's uncle, to 
the Isma'ili imamate while reasserting the legitimacy of the Musta'lian 
line of imams. In the Iqa' sawa'iq al-irgham, the term hashishiyya is 
used twice in reference to the Syrian Nizaris without any el a n a t i o n .This implies that the term had already, by the early decades of the 
twelfth century, acquired a generally-known meaning in the Muslim 
world, or at least in Egypt and Syria. 
The Syrian Nizaris are again referred to as 'Hashishiyya' in the 
earliest known Saljuq chronicle, written in 1183 by Imad al-Din 
Muhammad al-Katib al-Isfahani (d. 1201) whose history, the Nusrat 
al-fatra, is now extant only in an abridged version compiled in 1226 by 
al-Bndari.It is also interesting to note that these early Saljuq 
chroniclers use the terms hashishiyya, malahida and batiniyya inter- 
changeably.4 Only a few other contemporary Muslim historians, 
notably Abu Shama and Ibn Muyassar, occasionally used the term 
hashishiyya (singular, hashishi) in reference to the Nizaris of Syria 

(Sham): while none of these Muslim authors provided any derivative 
explanation for their use of this term. Ibn Muyassar, for instance, 
merely states that in Syria they are called 'Hashishiyya'; in Alamut, they 
are known as Batiniyya and 'Malahida'; in Khurasan, they are called 
Taelimiyya, and they all are Isma'ilis. Subsequently, the term seems to 
have fallen into disuse; Ibn Khaldun (d. 1406) is among the rare 
Muslim authors writing after the thirteenth century who states that the 
Syrian Nizaris, once called as 'al-Hashishiyya al-Isma'iliyya', were 
known in his time as thei d a w ia .The Persian historians of the Ilkhanid period, including Juwayni and 
Rashid al-Din, who are the main sources for the history of the Persian 
Nizari community during the Alamut period, do not use the term 
hashishiyya in reference to the Persian Nizaris. In fact, the term 
hashishi and its variants do not appear at all, to this author's 
knowledge, in any of the Persian texts of the Alamut or post-Alamut 
period which have references to the Nizari Isma'ilis. Mediaeval Persian 
authors generally designated the Nizaris as malahida or mulahida when 
desiring to employ abusive terms. But W. Madelung, the foremost 
western authority on the Isma'ilis and the Zaydis, has recently 
discovered that the Persian Nizaris, too, were called 'Hashishis' in some 
contemporary Zaydi sources written in the Arabic language in the 
Caspian region during the first half of the thirteenth century. In these 
hostile Zaydi texts, the Isma'ili community at large is often referred to 
as 'Malahida', while 'Hashishi' is more specifically applied to the Nizari 
fida'is sent from Alamut on assassination missions.' 
Thus, the 
argument of Bernard Lewis that the term hashishi was local to Syria, 
and that it was never used by Muslims in reference to the Persian 
Nizaris, has proved to be erroneos.It is safe to assume, however, that 
the term hashishi did originate in the Arabic-speaking Muslim 
countries, but it failed, unlike the word mulhid (plural, malahida), to 
acquire currency in the Persian language, which was also chosen as the 
religious language of the Persian Nizari community. 
Hashish, or hashisha, is the Arabic name for a product of hemp, a 
cultivable plant whose Latin name is cannabis sativa. This plant, and its 
more common variety Indian hemp (cannabis Zndica), have been 
known and used in the Near East since ancient times as a drug with 
intoxicating effects. The seeds and leaves of the hemp plant, as well as 
the products derived from it, have acquired different names and 
nicknames in India, Persia and the Arab world, including banj (bang), 
shahdanaj, qinnab and kit9 But it is not known how and when the 
Arabic word hashish, which originally meant 'dry herb', came to be 
applied as a nickname to the hemp plant, or rather to its resin which 

Origins and Early Formation of the Legends 
9 1 
contains the active element of hemp. At any rate, this hallucinatory 
drug must have been rather widely used by the time of the adoption of 
the word hashish as its nickname. Subsequently, the nickname itself led 
to the derivation of terms designating a person (or persons) using or 
being addicted to this product, notably hashishi (plural, hashishiyya; 
colloquial plurals hashishiyyin and hashishin) and, less commonly, 
hashshash (plural, hashshashin). The earliest known written attestation 
of the designation hashishiyya occurred, as noted, in reference to the 
Syrian Nizaris in the Musta'lian polemical epistle issued around 1123. 
This document did not explain why the term was applied to the 
Nizaris, although it may be assumed that its application implied the 
idea but not the fact that the Nizaris were actually hashish users. At 
any rate, it is evident that by the beginning of the twelfth century, the 
word hashishiyya had already been a term familiar to the Muslims for 
some time, dating at least to the second half of the eleventh century and 
preceding the Nizari-Musta'lian schism. 
The use of hashish grew significantly in Syria, Egypt and other 
Muslim countries during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, especially 
among the lower strata of society. It was at this time that the harmful 
effects of hashish began to be discussed extensively throughout Muslim 
society; and, starting in the thirteenth century, numerous tracts were 
written by Muslim authors who described these effects in terms of 
different physical, mental, moral and religiousateories.'In particu- 
lar, Muslim writers stressed that the extended use of hashish would 
have extremely harmful effects on the user's morality and religion, 
relaxing his attitude towards those duties, such as praying and fasting, 
specified by the sacred law of Islam." As a result, the hashish user 
would qualify for a low social and moral status, similarly to that of a 
mulhid or heretic in religion. It was particularly in this sense that the 
Muslim jurists argued against hashish users, and strongly demanded 
their punishment as criminals and heretics. 
As Professor Franz Rosenthal has observed, one thing stands out 
clearly in the entire mediaeval discussion of hashish by Muslim writers: 
a certain class distinction was made between confirmed addicts 
and the rest of the people . . . Hashish eaters were believed to be 
low-class people either by nature or by being reduced to that state 
through their habit which impaired all their faculties but in 
particular those moral and character qualities that determine the 
individual's standing in society.12 
Thus, hashish users were plainly regarded as social outcasts and 

criminals, and the hashishiyya were branded as dangerous to Islam and 
society, and condemned as such by majority opinion at least from the 
latter part of the eleventh century. 
It was in the abusive senses of 'low-class rabble' and 'irreligious 
social outcasts' that the term hashishiyya seems to have been used 
metaphorically in reference to the Nizari Isma'ilis during the twelfth 
and thirteenth centuries, and not because the Nizaris or their fida'is 
secretly used hashish in a regular manner, which in any event would 
not have been public knowledge. Needless to add that addiction to a 
debilitating drug like hashish would have been rather detrimental to the 
success of the fida'is who often had to wait patiently for long periods 
before finding a suitable opportunity to carry out their missions. Even 
abstracting from the ascetic character of Hasan Sabbah, who personally 
instituted the sect's revolutionary policies, the obedience and discipline 
of the Nizari fida'is was not without its antecedents among earlier Shi'i 
groups which were similarly imbued with elitism and a unique sense of 
group solidarity and devotion. In modern times, too, similar behaviour 
has been manifested by certain Muslim groups espousing martyrology. 
At any rate, the f a cremains that neither the Isma'ili texts which have 
been recovered so far nor any contemporary non-Isma'ili Muslim texts, 
which were generally hostile towards the Nizaris, attest to the actual 
use of hashish by the Nizaris. Indeed, the major Muslim historians of 
the Nizaris, such as Juwayni, who generally attribute all types of 
sinister motives and beliefs to the Isma'ilis, do not even refer to the 
Nizaris as 'Hashishis'. The few Arabic sources which do refer to the 
Nizaris as 'Hashishis' never explain this appellation in terms of the use 
of hashish, even though they were prepared to heap all sorts of 
defamatory accusations upon the heads of the Nizaris. 
Muslims who were familiar with Shi'i martyrology did not require 
an explanation in order to understand the self-sacrificing behaviour of 
the fida'is. As a result, Muslim authors, unlike western writers, did not 
fantasize about the sect's secret practices. The available evidence 
indicates that it was the name Hashishiyya that in time led to the 
unfounded suggestion that the Nizaris, or their fida'is, used hashish in 
a regular manner; a myth which was accepted as reality during the 
Middle Ages and was essentially endorsed by Silvestre de Sacy and 
other orientalists of the nineteenth century. The hashish connection 
proved particularly appealing to mediaeval western observers who 
needed 'simple' explanations for the seemingly irrational behaviour of 
the Nizari fida'is. 
Under such circumstances, beginning in the second half of the twelfth 
century, Arabic variants of the term hashishi were heard and picked up 

Origins and Early Formation of the Legends 
locally in Syria by the Crusaders, who received their information about 
Muslims mainly through oral channels. This information served as the 
basis for a number of terms, such as Assassini, Assissini and 
Heyssessini, by which the Nizari Isma'ilis of Syria came to be 
designated in base-Latin sources of the Crusaders and in different 
European languages, resulting in the more familiar name 'Assassins'. 
The Nizari 'assassinations' later received further exaggeration in 
western popular lore and literature when the term 'assassin' entered the 
western languages as a new common noun meaning 'murderer'. At any 
rate, by the end of the fourteenth century the epithet hashishi was 
evidently no longer regarded as a term of abuse in Muslim society. Al- 
Maqrizi (d. 1442), the famous Egyptian historian who has an 
informative section called 'the hashish of the poor' (hashishat al- 
fidqara) in his well-known book dealing with the antiquities of Cairo,13 
relates that by his time the use of hashish had indeed reached a peak; it 
was discussed and utilized, even among the better classes of Cairo and 
Damascus, publicly and without inhibition. Nevertheless, al-Maqrizi, 
too, related an anecdote about hashish and the Isma'ilis, stating that 
around the year 1392 a Persian Isma'ili, whom he now designates as a 
'Mulhid' and not a 'Hashishi', prepared electuaries made of hashish, 
honey and spices which were sold under the name of uqda to members 
of the upper classes in Cairo. 
It is, therefore, not surprising that none of the variants of the 
Assassin legends can be found in Muslim sources produced during the 
twelfth and thirteenth centuries; the period of the political prominence 
of the Nizaris in Persia and Syria which partially coincided with the 
formative period of these legends found in European sources. The 
Muslim authors of the pre-Mongol times, who had socio-cultural and 
religious affinities with the Isma'ilis, did not find it necessary to 
fantasize about the secret practices of the Nizari fida'is. The legends 
make their original appearance in the western sources in connection 
with the Syrian Nizaris whose activities and reputation had attracted 
the attention of the Crusaders and other occidental observers. The 
Crusaders had no contacts with the Nizari community in Persia, and 
consequently they did not produce comparable 'imaginative' descrip- 
tions of the Persian Nizaris of the Alamut period. It was only starting 
with Marco Polo's account of the 'Assassins' that the Assassin legends 
began to be extended to the parent Nizari community in Persia, despite 
the fact that at least some of the occidental sources had earlier 
recognized the supremacy of the Persian Nizaris over their Syrian co- 
religionists. 
It is my contention, as argued below, that Westerners themselves were 

responsible for fabricating the Assassin legends in their familiar, 
popular forms, and putting them into circulation in the Latin East as 
well as in Europe. These legends, rooted essentially in the 'imaginative 
ignorance' of the mediaeval Europeans, did nevertheless draw on some 
important bits and pieces of information or disinformation as well as 
misunderstood rumours, hostile allegations and exaggerated half-truths 
which were picked up locally and orally. Such oral channels, as noted, 
were readily available to the Franks, not only through direct encounters 
with the Muslims but also through the close relations existing in 
Crusader times between the Frankish circles and oriental Christians 
who had their own contacts with the Muslims. 
The Syrian Nizaris, who possessed a vulnerable and small princi- 
pality in a hostile milieu, made an important impact, quite dispro- 
portionate to their numbers or political power, on the regional politics 
of the Latin East. This was particularly the case when they were led by 
Rashid al-Din Sinan, their most famous leader and the original 'Old 
Man of the Mountain'. Indeed, it was Sinan who reorganized the Syrian 
Nizari community and led them to the peak of their power and fame. 
Other factors, too, contributed to the Crusaders' impressions of the 
Syrian Nizaris. These sectarians, detested by many of their Muslim 
neighbours, were singled out for all types of defamation and the matter 
could not have escaped the attention of the Crusaders who, in a rare 
instance of its kind, adopted a special appellation, 'Assassins', in 
reference to the Nizaris, echoing the names such as 'Hashishiyya' 
applied to them abusively by their Muslim enemies. Then there were 
the assassinations attributed to the Nizaris in a highly exaggerated 
manner by their Muslim adversaries; altogether fewer than five 
Frankish personalities may have actually been killed by the fida'is 
during the entire period of the Crusaders' presence in Outremer. 
Nevertheless, it was the exaggerated reports of the alleged Nizari 
assassinations and the daring behaviour of the real fida'is, who usually 
carried out their missions in public places and rarely survived their 
victims, which greatly impressed the Crusaders, who would rarely 
endanger their own lives for other than worldly rewards. This explains 
why the Assassin legends came to revolve entirely around the fida'is, 
especially in connection with their recruitment and training. 
The stage was thus set, from the time of Sinan's leadership in the 
second half of the twelfth century, for the formation of the Assassin 
legends, which provided satisfactory explanations for behaviour that 
seemed irrational or superhuman to the mediaeval western mind, then 
generously endowed with imaginative powers for interpreting all things 
Oriental or Islamic. The Assassin legends, consisting of a number of 

Origins and Early Formation of the Legends 
separate but connected stories, developed gradually, and not strictly in 
terms of clearly identifiable stages, although they followed an ascending 
tendency or trend towards more elaborate versions. They culminated in 
the version popularized by Marco Polo who combined a number of 
such legends in a fully integrated form, also adding his own original 
contribution in the form of a secret 'garden of paradise' where earthly 
delights were procured for the fida'is. Different legends or components 
of particular legends were 'imagined' sometimes independently and at 
times concurrently by different authors; while, in a general sense, most 
authors used the accounts of their predecessors as the basis for making 
their own contributions. In the event, from the latter part of the twelfth 
century, the occidental chroniclers, travellers and envoys to the Latin 
East who had something to say on h e  'Assassins' participated, as if in 
tacit collusion, in the process of fabricating, transmitting and legitimiz- 
ing the Assassin legends. A century later the legends had acquired wide 
currency and had come to be accepted as reliable descriptions of Nizari 
practices, in much the same way as the earlier anti-Ismaeili 'black 
legend' formulated by Muslim writers had in time come to be accepted 
as the true expression of Isma'ili motives and teachings. 
An exhaustive survey of different categories of mediaeval European 
sources bearing on the 'Assassins' is beyond the scope of this study.14 
For our purposes it will suffice to review the origins and some of the 
early developments and milestones in the formation of the major 
European myths of the 'Assassins', from the second half of the twelfth 
century to the turn of the fourteenth century. 
The earliest known European account purporting to explain the self- 
sacrificing behaviour of the fida'is was produced by Burchard of 
Strassburg who had visited Syria in the autumn of 1175. Burchard 
included this account, as part of his description of the 'Heyssessini' 
('Assassins'), in his report to Frederick I Barbarossa who had sent him 
on a diplomatic mission to Saladin. 
After relating that the Assassins have a prince or lord who strikes the 
greatest fear into the Saracen princes and the neighbouring Christian 
lords, because he has a habit of killing them in an astonishing way, 
Burchard adds: 
the method by which this is done is as follows: this prince 
possesses in the mountains numerous and most beautiful palaces, 
surrounded by very high walls, so that none can enter except by a 
small and very well-guarded door. In these palaces he has many of 
the sons of his peasants brought up from early childhood. He has 

them taught various languages, as Latin, Greek, Roman, Saracen 
as well as many others. These young men are taught by their 
teachers from their earliest youth to their full manhood, that they 
must obey the lord of their land in all his words and commands; 
and that if they do so, he, who has power over all living gods, will 
give them the joys of paradise. They are also taught that they 
cannot be saved if they resist his will in anything. Note that, from 
the time when they are taken in as children, they see no one but 
their teachers and masters and receive no other instruction until 
they are summoned to the presence of the Prince to kill someone. 
When they are in the presence of the Prince, he asks them if they 
are willing to obey his commands, so that he may bestow paradise 
upon them. Whereupon, as they have been instructed, and 
without any objection or doubt, they throw themselves at his feet 
and reply with fervour, that they will obey him in all things that 
he may command. Thereupon the Prince gives each one of them a 
golden dagger and sends them out to kill whichever prince he has 
marked down.'* 
It is certain that Burchard must have heard some oral traditions 
about the Nizaris during his brief stay in Syria in 1175, when the 
memory ofi the first unsuccessful Nizari attempt on Saladin's life, which 
had taken place a few months earlier, was still fresh in local circles. 
This may, indeed, explain why he chose to include a description of the 
Nizaris in his diplomatic report. But it is not clear to what extent 
Burchard merely repeated details heard by him locally from oral 
sources. At any rate, it may be safe to assume that, being an 
uninformed observer of the East, he fully believed the authenticity of 
what was related to him in Syria, probably by Frankish and local 
Christian sources; and, in the absence of earlier written reports, he 
personally acted imaginatively in combining the pieces, or th; building 
blocks which appear in his tale, into what seemed to him to be a 
complete and sensible whole. This becomes all the more plausible if 
Burchard's account is compared with the much more factual descrip- 
tion of the 'Assassins' written a few years later by the well-informed 
William of Tyre, who spent some three decades in the Holy Land and 
possibly had personal contacts with the local Nizaris. As noted, 
William may even have been present when, in 1173, Sinan's ambas- 
sadors met with King Amalric I in Jerusalem; to Burchard, Sinan was 
- 
merely a remote lord of a strange people living in impregnable 
mountains. As a result, William, equally impressed by the devotion of 
the Nizaris to their chief, neither reproduced any local tales which by 

Origins and Early Formation of the Legends 
then must have been circulating in Crusader circles nor did he give free 
rein to his own imagination in a matter that was to perplex the Franks 
for a long time to come. Similarly, Benjamin of Tudela, the Spanish 
rabbi who travelled extensively in the Near East and was in Syria 
earlier in 1167, did not fantasize about the secret practices of the 
Nizaris. Indeed, with very few exceptions, Europeans who were long- 
term residents of the Holy Land during Crusader times did not 
contribute in any important fashion to the formation of the Assassin 
legends. 
In Burchard's account of the Nizaris, we have the earliest written 
statement of the secret procedures utilized for the recruitment and 
training of the Nizari fida'is, which may be designated here as the 
'training legend'. Would-be fida'is were allegedly recruited in child- 
hood and then trained by special teachers in complete isolation until 
they were ready to be dispatched on their missions. The training was 
designed to prepare the youthful recruits to become unconditionally 
responsive to any command of their lord. However, Burchard also cites 
an inducement factor in the form of a reward: a promise by the Nizari 
chief to bestow 'paradise' on them if they always acted obediently. 
This, too, may be regarded as the first, rudimentary statement of the 
'paradise legend', which in different forms was to become an integral 
component of the Assassin legends. 
The Nizari sources which have been recovered so far do not contain 
any details on the organization and training of the fida'is during the 
Alamut period, if ever such information existed; nor can such details be 
found in contemporary Sunni and non-Isma'ili Shi'i sources dealing 
with the Nizaris. In Persia, the fidu'is do not seem to have been 
organized into any special group, while in Syria they were evidently 
organized, at least temporarily, in the time of Sinan. Most of 
Burchard's details about their rigorous training programme, adopted or 
conjectured independently by later occidental writers, may be regarded 
as gross exaggeration or a fictitious portrayal of what may have 
actually taken place, especially regarding the young age of the recruits 
and their prolonged training in isolation. Also, there is no evidence to 
suggest that the fida'is received specific instructions in languages. Even 
if the Syrian fida'is did receive any training, it would more probably 
have been of a technical nature, designed to ensure the success of their 
performance in the field rather than to condition and shape their mental 
disposition from an early age; at any rate, all matters related to the 
activities of the fida'is would have been among the Nizaris' most 
closely guarded secrets. Therefore, it is safe to assume that no factual 
information would have been available to outsiders, local Christians 

and Muslims alike. Burchard's detailed account of the recruitment and 
training of the fida'is should, thus, be taken to represent an 
'imaginative' and exaggerated construction based on rumours. 
In contrast to his 'imaginary' description of the training programme, 
Burchard's brief reference to the paradise promised to the fida'is is 
essentially based on distorted Nizari beliefs of the time; its sources, 
therefore, can be identified more readily. By the twelfth century, 
Muslims had long been familiar with the Islamic traditions, rooted in 
the Quran, which held that pious believers, those who feared God and 
followed the right path, as well as martyrs of Islam, would be 
guaranteed an eternal place in Paradise as their deserved reward in the 
afterlife. Paradise was described rather vividly in the Quran. For the 
Shi'i Muslims, their imams would also ensure through their interces- 
sionary role on the Day of Judgement that their followers would receive 
their just reward by being admitted into Paradise. The Nizari Isma'ilis, 
as the partisans of the only rightful imam of the time, certainly 
expected to qualify as a saved community for the paradisal state in the 
afterlife. 
There were, however, more specific reasons why the Nizaris in 
general and their fida'is in particular expected to be deserving of 
Paradise. Ever since the martyrdom of the imam Husayn and his 
companionk in 680, the theme of martyrology had occupied a 
particular place in the Shi'i ethos, which accorded a unique status, 
comparable to that of the pious believers, to those devotees who gave 
their lives in the service of their creed and imam. This was, indeed, the 
manner in which the fida'is were viewed by the rest of the Nizari 
community during the Alamut period. The fida'is, whether they 
returned safely from their missions or lost their lives as martyrs, were 
held in high esteem, attested to by the rolls of honour kept at Alamut 
and other major Nizari fortresses. As a rare instance of its kind, we also 
have the already-noted poem by Ra'is Hasan, a Persian Nizari 
historian, poet and functionary of the early thirteenth century, in which 
the three fida'is who had killed a Turkish amir are praised for their 
self-sacrificing behaviour which had entitled them to the joys of the 
otherworldly paradise.16 Similar ideas are echoed in the scattered and 
brief references to the fida'is found in Muslim historical sources; they 
reveal, for instance, that the mothers of the fida'is would happily 
expect their sons to become martyrs and as such enter Paradise. 
Burchard could easily have heard such local traditions regarding the 
Nizaris' hope of access to Paradise. 
There were even more immediate reasons for the appearance of the 
paradise connection in Burchard's account. He visited Syria in 1175, a 

Origins and Early Formation of the Legends 
few years after the declaration of the qiyama or Resurrection in the 
Nizari community. This declaration, initiated in Persia in 1164, had 
been repeated shortly afterwards in Syria by Sinan. The Muslim sources 
relate that Sinan himself had to deal personally, in 1176, with a group 
of the Syrian Nizaris who had somehow misunderstood the qiyama 
doctrine, indulging in libertine practices. Such episodes also provided 
further suitable excuses for Muslim opponents of the Nizaris to accuse 
them of the outright abandonment of the law and of exercising 
antinomianism. Traces of these accusations, preserved by some Syrian 
historians, are clearly reflected in the account of Burchard who states 
that the 'Heyssessini' (Nizaris) 'live without law; they eat swine's flcsh 
against the law of the Saracens, and make use of all women'. Similar 
accusations are reported in William of Tyre's account; all this reveals 
that by the 1170s the Syrian Nizaris were already being accused by 
other Muslims of practices incorrectly associated with the declaration 
of the qiyama. It is equally clear that such accusations, in those early 
post-qiyama years, were prevalent enough to have attracted Burchard's 
attention during his short stay in Syria. 
In a distorted fashion, Burchard seems to have heard something else, 
too, about one of the central ideas of the qiyama doctrine then 
preached within the Syrian Nizari community. As noted, the qiyama, or 
the awaited Day of Judgement, was interpreted spiritually for the 
Nizaris on the basis of the well-known Isma'ili method of esoteric 
interpretation. On this basis, it was explained that only the Nizaris, as 
the sole community of true believers acknowledging the rightful imam 
of the time, were capable of understanding the spiritual reality and the 
true meaning of all religions and, as such, Paradise had now been 
created for them in this world. In other words, by contrast to other 
religious communities, both Muslim and non-Muslim, the Nizaris were 
henceforth collectively admitted into Paradise and their ddwa implied 
an invitation into that paradisal state. Burchard must have heard about 
the important 'paradise' of the Nizaris in such a way as to have 
warranted its inclusion in his account in a key role. Like other 
mediaeval Europeans with some limited and distorted knowledge of 
Islam, Burchard may also have been familiar with the ideas, then 
current in certain Christian circles, about the 'sensual' nature of the 
paradise promised to the Muslims. The Latin translation of the Quran, 
produced in 1143, had already introduced the Islamic paradise to 
mediaeval Europe, and Pedro de Alfonso and others after him in the 
twelfth century had dwelled polemically on the hedonistic delights of 
the Islamic 'garden of paradise' to prove that Islam was not a spiritual 
religion, and, therefore, not comparable to Christianity. In time, the 

European conceptions of the Islamic paradise, rooted in Quranic 
descriptions, were incorporated into the Assassin legends, culminating 
in Marco Polo's detailed account of the Nizari 'garden of paradise'. 
It is also important to note that the notion of 'paradise' is utilized in 
Burchard's account in a highly legendary and metaphysical manner, in 
so far as the access to it was placed, in an unexplained fashion, under 
the full control of the Nizari chief who was, thus, portrayed as a 
superhuman figure. He was to be feared and obeyed by the fida'is just 
as the Quran had specified the behaviour of the believers towards God. 
This should not cause any surprise, however, because Burchard's 
account purported to explain the puzzling obedience of the fida'is 
precisely in terms of the extraordinary hold exercised over them by 
their chief. In this connection it should be recalled that the Nizari chief 
to whom Burchard is referring in his account was Rashid al-Din Sinan, 
who did indeed enjoy unprecedented popularity and veneration in the 
Syrian Nizari community. This is clearly reported by the contemporary 
Andalusian traveller Ibn Jubayr, who passed through Syria shortly 
before his death in 1184." In a Syrian Nizari hagiographical work 
produced later in the sixteenth century, by an obscure Nizari author 
known as Abu Firas, Sinan is actually exalted as a saintly hero and 
different wonders and miraculous acts are attributed to him.'* A few 
Sunni authors of the Mamluk period, too, ascribe extraordinary powers 
and acts to Sinan, presumably drawing on oral traditions.19 All this 
may be taken to reflect Sinan's popular reputation for the spectacular; a 
reputation which was evidently circulating already in his lifetime in 
Syria and which also came to be reflected, though in a distorted 
fashion, in Burchard's contemporary account. 
At any rate, the 'paradise legend' is already distinguishable in an 
embryonic form in Burchard's account; henceforth, it became a 
permanent component of the Assassin legends. In line with the general 
trend of these legends towards more exaggerated versions during the 
early period of their formation, the 'paradise legend' became gradually 
more removed from the actual beliefs of the Nizaris concerning 
Paradise; progressing from the initial depiction of the sectarians' hope 
to gain the celestial paradise to cravings for the carnal delights of a 
terrestrial garden of paradise, constructed secretly by the Nizari chief to 
simulate the delights of the promised Paradise. Burchard's account of 
the recruitment and training of the fida'is also contains the central 
aspects of another legend, which were subsequently adopted, modified 
and elaborated in different ways by successive generations of European 
writers. Thus, by 1175, the stage had been set for the formation and 
widespread circulation of the Assassin legends in Crusader circles and 

Origins and Early Formation of the Legends 
European sources. Burchard's account itself, included in his diplomatic 
report to Emperor Frederick I, was already available in Germany by the 
late 1170s; and it was seen and utilized by others in northern Europe, 
especially Arnold of Liibeck. 
Almost all the European writers, after Burchard, who had something 
to say about the 'Assassins', also fantasized about the recruitment and 
training of the fida'is, repeating with minor modifications the details 
contained in Burchard's account. All these sources essentially aimed to 
show the ingenious methods utilized by the Old Man of the Mountain, 
who cleverly combined indoctrination with psychological deceit based 
on the promise of Paradise, to condition and control the disciplinarian 
behaviour of the fida'is. As noted, William of Tyre does not relate any 
details on the alleged training of the would-be fida'is; but all other 
European sources of the later decades of the twelfth and the thirteenth 
centuries, including the old French continuations of William of Tyre's 
Historia, with minor variations state that the Old Man recruited his 
future fida'is at an early age, or even in childhood, sometimes 
separating them by force from their parents, and then had them trained 
by special teachers in his own house, palace, or in certain secluded 
places, always deceiving them by promising them the joys of Paradise?' 
In this connection, James of Vitry's account is of particular importance, 
representing a further development, or a subsequent stage, in the early 
formation of the Assassin legends. 
'The Old Man, their lord', explains James of Vitry, 
causes boys of this people to be brought up in secret and delightful 
places [locis secretis et delectabilibus], and having had them 
diligently trained and instructed in the different kinds of lan- 
guages, sends them to various provinces with daggers, and orders 
them to slay the great men of the Christians, as well as of the 
Saracens . . . promising them, for the execution of this command, 
that they shall have far greater delights, and without end, in 
paradise, after death [in paradiso post mortem], than even those 
amidst which they had been reared. If they chance to die in this 
act of obedience they are regarded as martyrs by their com- 
panions, and being placed by that people among their saints, are 
held in the greatest reverence. Their parents are enriched with 
many gifts by the master, who is called the Old Man [Senex] . . . 
Whence these wretched and misguided youths . . . undertake their 
deadly legation with such joy and delight.21 
As noted, James of Vitry, the Bishop of Acre (1216-28), was the best 

informed Frankish observer of Muslim affairs in the Latin East, after 
William of Tyre. His account of the Nizari Isma'ilis is basically 
modelled on what William had written a few decades earlier, although 
he added his own embellishments. At any rate, the account of James, 
produced during the first half of the thirteenth century, is independent 
of Burchard's account; and in terms of its legendary content falls 
somewhere between the rather sober description of the Archbishop of 
Tyre and the imaginative narrative of Burchard. Unlike William, James 
seems to have been more readily influenced by some of the tales he had 
heard locally; but, in contradistinction to Burchard, some of the central 
beliefs of the contemporary Nizaris and their fida'is are more clearly 
and accurately reflected in his account. Thus, James correctly relates 
that the Nizaris held that 'all obedience indifferently shown by them 
towards their superior is meritorious for eternal life', and that the 
fida'is who did not return from their missions would be regarded as 
martyrs by their companions and as such they were held in greatest 
reverence. 
James of Vitry, too, has something to say on the training programme 
of the @a'is, 
which he must have heard locally. But he omits many of 
the intricate details found in Burchard's account, revealing that he had 
not blindly believed his local oral sources. Like other Frankish writers 
before him, except William of Tyre, James also connects the obedience 
of the fida'is to their hope of gaining Paradise in the afterlife, which 
had been promised to them. It should be emphasized here that this form 
of the paradise connection, rooted in actual Nizari beliefs, appears in 
all the western accounts of the Nizaris, from Burchard to Marco Polo. 
During this period, only William of Tyre and Thietmar do not connect 
the devotion of the fida'is to the promised Paradise. Thietmar, a 
German traveller who visited the Holy Land during the early decades of 
the thirteenth century and was thus a contemporary of James, merely 
states that the 'Assassins' obeyed their master until death.22 Further- 
more, in all the western accounts before Marco Polo, one does not find 
any causal connection between the places where the fidu'is were 
trained and the celestial paradise whose delights awaited them. 
James of Vitry's account differs in one significant aspect from all 
other western accounts produced before Marco Polo. He is the earliest 
western author to refer to the training places of the would-be fida'is as 
the locis secretis et delectabilibus, the secret and delightful places, as if 
vaguely anticipating the terrestrial 'secret garden of paradise' elabor- 
ated later by Marco Polo. James does, in fact, imply that the future 
fida'is enjoyed certain delights in the course of their training, which 
presumably would have made them even more eager for experiencing 

Origins and Early Formation of the Legends 
the greater otherworldly pleasures, promised all along as their ultimate 
reward. However, James does not provide any details on these alleged 
'secret and delightful places', and the delights that the would-be fida'is 
supposedly enjoyed as trainees. It is quite possible that such ideas and 
insinuations were developed on the basis of some misunderstood, or 
imaginatively distorted, local rumours then circulating among the 
Crusaders in the Latin East. Accordingly, during his long ministry at 
Acre in close proximity to the Nizari territory in Syria, James of Vitry 
could easily have heard about the gardens and the water conduits of 
Masyaf, Qadmus, Kahf and other Nizari fortresses in Syria. In his 
account, James does, in fact, speak of the Syrian Nizari castles 'with 
their suburbs and the valleys, which are most fruitful in all species of 
fruits and corn, and most delightful for their amenity'. 
It is a known fact that Hasan Sabbah planted numerous trees in the 
Alamut valley, and also improved the cultivation and irrigation systems 
there. His future successor, Buzurg-Ummid, adopted similar measures 
and completely changed Lamasar into a 'delightful place' during his 
long governorship of that castle in northern Persia. Other Nizari 
leaders, too, including Sinan in Syria, concerned themselves with such 
matters, which transformed the major Nizari fortresses into delightful 
sites and agriculturally self-sufficient enclaves, guaranteeing their 
survival under long sieges. It is, thus, possible that by his 'secret and 
delightful places' James may have been merely referring to the Nizari 
castles themselves. Be that as it may, for James these delightful places 
were clearly distinguished from the celestial paradise promised to the 
fida'is as a reward for their obedience. As in other accounts, here, too, 
the behaviour of the fida'is is essentially motivated by their desire to 
enter the metaphysical, celestial paradise; and their 'delightful' training 
places merely served to give them a foretaste of the delights that 
awaited them in the afterlife. This is why James explains that the 
otherworldly delights, expected by the fida'is, would be superior to the 
delights which the fida'is had already enjoyed in this world during their 
training. According to James, the obedience of the fida'is was not 
motivated, as in Marco Polo's account, by their desire to return to their 
earlier delightful training places or to a 'garden'; it was rather the 
expectation of the bliss of the celestial paradise that prepared the 
fida'is for self-sacrifice. 
Thus, in terms of its essential points, James of Vitry's account is a 
more accurate portrayal of the actual Nizari beliefs than what the much 
less-informed Burchard had earlier said on the subject. Furthermore, 
James does not depict the Nizari chief as a superhuman figure; although 
here, too, he is represented as a deceitful character. Nevertheless, 

James of Vitry made his own important contribution to the develop- 
ment of the Assassin legends, in so far as he introduced the idea of the 
'secret and delightful places', and in doing so he anticipated, in a crude 
and partial manner, the Old Man of the Mountain's terrestrial secret 
'garden of paradise', which was to become fully elaborated in Marco 
Polo's account. James of Vitry may, therefore, rightfully be regarded as 
one of the major early proponents of the Assassin legends, and his 
account represents an important milestone in the early formation of 
these legends. 
Another milestone can be traced to the German writer Arnold of 
Lubeck (d. 1212), who wrote his Chronicle before 1210 as a 
continuation of Helmond of Bosau's Chronicle of the Slavs. While 
reporting Conrad of Montferrat's assassination in 1192, Arnold 
produces his own account of the 'Heissessin' ('Assassins'). It should be 
recalled that the same Arnold of Lubeck had access to the diplomatic 
report of his contemporary countryman, Burchard of Strassburg, and 
used this report as one of his sources. However, Arnold also had his 
own direct oral sources in the Latin East, which he seems to have 
visited briefly in 1172. 
Admitting at the outset that the things he had heard about the Old 
Man might appear ridiculous (ridiculosum), and then dismissing such 
doubts on the account of the reliability of his witnesses, Arnold of 
Liibeck relates: 
'this Old Man has by his witchcraft so bemused the men of his 
country, that they neither worship nor believe in any God but 
himself. Likewise he entices them in a strange manner with such 
hopes and with promises of such pleasures with eternal enjoy- 
ment, that they prefer rather to die than to live. Many of them 
even, when standing on a high wall, will jump off at his nod or 
command, and, shattering their skulls, die a miserable death. The 
most blessed, so he affirms, are those who shed the blood of men 
and in revenge for such deeds themselves suffer death. When 
therefore any of them have chosen to die in this way, murdering 
someone by craft and then themselves dying so blessedly in 
revenge for him, he himself hands them knives which are, so to 
speak, consecrated to this affair, and then intoxicates them with 
such a potion that they are plunged into ecstasy and oblivion, 
displays to them by his magic certain fantastic dreams, full of 
pleasures and delights, or rather of trumpery, and promises them 
eternal possession of these things in reward for such deeds.23 
Arnold of Lubeck's account is important in several respects. First, by 

Origins and Early Fornation of the Legends 
summarily dismissing his own doubts about the authenticity of what 
had been related to him by his oral sources and affirming the reliability 
of these same sources, Arnold attests that from early on the Assassin 
legends had come to enjoy a reputation for authenticity in Crusader 
circles. This, of course, greatly facilitated the subsequent elaboration 
and transmission of these legends in mediaeval Europe. Secondly, and 
much more significantly, this is the earliest western source referring to 
an unexplained intoxicating potion administered by the Old Man to the 
fida'is; the first statement of a new legend which may be designated as 
the 'hashish legend', and which was later adopted by Marco Polo and 
other western sources. This new legend about the hashish dreams of the 
fida'is was, in all probability, invoked by the abusive designations, 
connected with hashish, which were at the time applied to the Syrian 
Nizari Ismaeilis by their Muslim opponents. These designations were 
now interpreted literally. Thirdly, Arnold's account gave a new twist to 
the 'paradise legend', allowing the fida'is to enjoy the delights of the 
celestial paradise in yet another, hallucinatory, fashion in this world. 
Arnold of Liibeck's account of the Nizari fida'is is even more 
removed from the reality than those of Burchard and James of Vitry. 
Like other Frankish authors, Arnold too depicts the Old Man of the 
Nizaris as a scheming manipulator of the fida'is' motivations; a 
deceitful leader who beguiles the gullible fida'is by promising them the 
delights of Paradise in the afterlife. But in Arnold's account the Old 
Man's deception takes on a new and more sinister form in so far as he 
now diabolically motivates them into self-sacrifice by simulating in 
them, under the double influences of a drug and his own magical 
powers, a delusion of the delights of Paradise. Thus, the otherworldly 
reward expected by the fida'is has, in Arnold's account, acquired a 
terrestrial dimension in that the fida'is are deluded, through hallucinat- 
ory dreams invoked by a narcotic drug, with the visions of Paradise and 
its delights. However, Arnold stops short of talking about any actual 
experimentation with such delights in a terrestrial 'garden of paradise' 
designed specifically for that purpose by the Old Man; another variant 
of the 'paradise legend' implied in James of Vitry's account and fully 
incorporated into the Assassin legends by Marco Polo. 
Finally, it is to be noted that Arnold's account alludes to yet another 
of the famous Assassin legends, the 'death-leap legend'. This most 
impressive story of how the Nizari fida'is would instantly leap to their 
death, from high towers or walls, at the command of their chief in 
order to demonstrate their loyalty and enable their chief to intimidate 
his enemies, was repeated with slight variations in many mediaeval 
European sources. It was first related in the old French continuations of 

William of Tyre's chronicle in connection with Henry of Champagne's 
reported visit, in 1194, to the Old Man of theountain." Count 
Henry, it will be recalled, had then recently succeeded Conrad of 
Montferrat to the throne of the Latin kingdom. The Nizari chief had, 
according to these occidental sources, staged the suicide demonstration 
in Henry's presence in order to dissuade him from contemplating any ill 
designs against the Syrian Nizari community. This legend had become 
quite famous in Europe by the end of the thirteenth century. It is, for 
instance, included in the Latin history of Marino Sanudo, the Venetian 
historian who himself travelled several times to the East and presented 
his historical work to Pope John XXII (1316-34) in 1321. Referring to 
the Nizari chief as Rex Arsasidarum, Marino places the suicide 
demonstration, which supposedly took place in the presence of Henry 
of Champagne, in the year 1193.' In some versions of this legend, 
including one appearing in the famous Italian collection of 100 old 
stories, the German emperor Frederick I1 replaces Henry of Champagne 
as the European dignitary in whose presence the Old Man (I1 Veglio) 
demonstrates the absolute obedience of his fida'i;while Arnold of 
Liibeck presents the legend as a customary demonstration of loyalty in 
the Nizari community. 
There is little doubt, however, that such death-leap demonstrations 
did not take place in the presence of Henry of Champagne or any other 
European dignitary. This legend may have been closely related to the 
hashish connection in that the f;&'is 
under the influence of that drug 
would presumably leap more readily to their death. At any rate, Arnold 
of Liibeck, who does not name any European monarch in his version, 
seems to have preserved this legend more faithfully as it had then 
evidently acquired popularity in the East. Like Arnold, Ibn Jubayr 
mentions this story as a customary practice of the Syrian Nizari 
comnlunity of Sinan's times.27 A few other eastern sources, too, contain 
the death-leap legend. Georgius Elmacin (Jirgis al-Makin), an Arabic- 
speaking Coptic historian who died in 1273, even transposes the scene 
of this legend to the Persian Nizari community of Hasan Sabbah's time. 
According to Elmacin, it was Hasan's son who had commanded the 
suicides of some f;&is in order to intimidate an ambassador of the 
Saljuq sultan Malikshah who had demanded obedience from the Nizari 
cmmunity.' Elmacin's entire account lacks historicity. 
L. Hellmuth has forwarded an interesting hypothesis regarding the 
origin of the death-leap legend.29 He argues that the eastern versions of 
this legend were in all probability based either directly on the ancient 
Alexander romance, which was well known in the East as well as in 
Europe, or on popular stories derived from that romance. According to 

Origins and Early Formation of the Legends 
a late version of the Alexander romance, Alexander the Great had 
intimidated the envoys of the Jews, whose country he was then 
invading, by ordering some of his soldiers to jump into a ravine.30 
Western writers, as was their custom, added their own embellishments 
and included European dignitaries in their Nizari death-leap accounts 
to make them more attractive to their European audiences. 
The contacts between the Franks and the Syrian Nizaris continued 
during the first half of the thirteenth century. But these contacts, 
culminating in the dealings between King Louis IX of France and the 
Old Man of the Mountain, did not in any way dispel the Assassin 
legends, which had continued to circulate. Joinville and his source Yves 
the Breton, who personally held discussions on doctrinal matters with 
the chief of the Syrian Nizaris, were perhaps the only thirteenth-century 
occidental authors who wrote about the sectarians without conmbut- 
ing to the Assassin legends. Both of them, as noted, merely attributed 
the obedience of the fida'is to the alleged Nizari belief in the 
transmigration of souls, allowing for the soul of a martyred fidu'i to be 
reincarnated in a body of higher rank which would be capable of 
enjoying greater comforts and pleasures. 
By 1256 the Persian Nizari state had collapsed under the onslaught 
of the Mongols. Soon afterwards, in the early 1270s, the Syrian Nizaris 
lost whatever authority and independence they had precariously 
retained after the fall of Alamut, becoming obedient subjects of the 
Mamluk state. By 1277, the Mamluk armies had also succeeded in 
reducing the Crusader dominions of Outremer to a small strip of 
coastland in Syria; and, in 1291, Acre itself, the last remaining 
stronghold of Christendom in the Holy Land, surrendered to the 
Mamluks. These developments, as noted, marked the end of the 
political power and prominence of the Nizari Ismaeilis as well as the 
termination of the Frankish-Nizari encounters in the Latin East, 
encounters which were to be immortalized by the Assassin legends. 
With the loss of their political prominence, the Nizaris disappeared 
from the historical stage and henceforth survived as a peaceful religious 
community. In no small measure, this was also due to the fact that the 
Nizari communities of Syria, Persia and elsewhere now made a 
deliberate effort to live clandestinely under different guises in order to 
safeguard their survival. As a result, there are only some scattered 
references to the Nizaris in the Muslim historiography of the early post- 
Alamut centuries. Under such circumstances, Europeans had even less 
reason to write or speculate about the Nizaris, with whom they no 
longer had any contacts. In fact, Westerners had remained unaware of 
the continued existence of the Nizaris after the thirteenth century; and 

it was not until the early decades of the nineteenth century that 
Europeans rediscovered them, once again in Syria. That the Nizaris 
were remembered at all by the Europeans during the later Middle Ages 
and subsequent centuries, was due to their past reputation and, indeed, 
to the wide currency of the Assassin legends in Europe. 
By the turn of the thirteenth century, the name 'Assassins' in its 
different forms, and the varied stories about the remote people who 
bore that name, had been made famous throughout Europe by the 
Crusaders and other Franks who had travelled to the East. These 
stories, especially those related to the obedience of the fiddis and the 
mysterious ways of the Old Man of the Mountain, had made such a 
deep impression that Provenal poets frequently made comparisons 
between their own romantic devotion to their ladies and the loyalty of 
the 'Assassins' to the 'Old  an'.^' The Assassin legends had now truly 
acquired an independent life of their own, especially in Italy, to where 
such legends had been constantly transmitted by members of the 
Venetian and other Italian trading communities of the Levant. 
With the disappearance of direct contacts between the Europeans 
and the Nizaris, the Assassin legends began to be further embellished; 
indeed, myths rooted in 'imaginative ignorance' could now come into 
full play. It was under such circumstances that the Venetian Marco 
Polo (1254-1324), the most famous of all the mediaeval European 
travellers, gave the Assassin legends a new lease of life under his own 
authority. 
Marco Polo's father and uncle, Niccolo and Maffeo, had already 
spent some seven years in the 1260s travelling in the East as far as the 
court of the Great Khan Qubilai (1260-94) in China. Qubilai, it will be 
recalled, was the brother and successor of Mongke (d. 1259) who had a 
few years earlier ordered the destruction of the Nizari fortresses in 
Persia. On their second journey to China, the Polo brothers had decided 
to take along Niccolb's young son Marco, then 17 years old. The Polo 
party left Venice in the summer of 1271, and in November 1271 they 
embarked on their eastward itinerary from Acre. In 1273, the three 
Venetian travellers traversed Persia through Kirman and Khurasan, 
about 17 years after the collapse of the Nizari state there. From Persia, 
the Polos proceeded to Balkh, Badakhshan and Pamir in the upper 
Oxus region, which since then have had important Nizari communities. 
Crossing the Pamir highlands, they descended to Kashgar and Yarkand, 
where lesser Nizari communities have been located. The party then 
crossed the Great Gobi Desert and finally reached the summer court of 
Qubilai in May 1275. The young Marco Polo immediately won the 
favour of Qubilai and served the Great Khan in different capacities 

Origins and Early Formation of the Legends 
during his 17-year stay in China. Charged with one last mission to 
accompany a Mongol princess to the Ilkhanid court in Persia, Marco 
Polo and the other two Venetian travellers embarked on their return 
journey in 1292, arriving in Venice three years later in 1295, after an 
absence of some 25 years. 
There was only one major upheaval in Marco Polo's final decades 
spent quietly in Venice as a wealthy and highly honoured citizen. In 
1298 he had taken command of one of the Venetian galleys which in 
that year participated in yet another of the then recurrent battles 
between Venice and Genoa. This time, the Genoese completely defeated 
the Venetian fleet, and captured some 7000 Venetians, among them 
Marco Polo. In prison in Genoa, Marco Polo had the account of his 
earlier travels committed to writing; he dictated his memories of 'the 
kingdoms and marvels of the East' to a fellow-prisoner known as 
Rusticiano or Rustichello of Pisa, a man of some literary talent and 
evidently a professional romance-writer. By the time Marco Polo was 
released from prison in August 1299, Rustichello had completed what 
may be regarded as the original version of Marco Polo's travels. This 
original version, written in a peculiar old French mingled with Italian, 
has never been recovered, but the work was soon translated into a 
number of Italian dialects as well as Latin. The complex problems 
related to the authenticity of the manuscripts of this famous travelogue 
have been analyzed by Sir Henry Yule (1820-89), H. Cordier (1849- 
1925), Arthur C. Moule (1873-1957) and other modern scholars. It 
merely suffices to note here that all the early manuscripts of Marco 
Polo, produced during the fourteenth century, suffer from various 
defects, including omissions and scribal revisions and interpolations. 
Marco Polo himself seems to have revised his travelogue during the 
latter part of his life in Venice, while Rustichello must have undoub- 
tedly added his own emendations to the original Franco-Italian text 
which was subsequently translated into Venetian and other dialects. 
Marco Polo interrupts his itinerary in eastern Persia to report what 
he claims to have heard there from several natives, some 30 years 
earlier, concerning the Old Man of the Mountain and hisssassins.The Venetian traveller, or rather his scribe Rustichello, relates: 
The Old Man was called in their language Alaodin . . . He dwelled 
in a most noble valley shut in between two very high mountains 
where he had made them make the largest garden and the most 
beautiful that ever was seen in this world . . . And here he had 
made them make the most beautiful houses and the most beautiful 
palaces that ever were seen, of wonderful variety, for they were all 

gilded and adorned in azure very well with all the fair things of 
the world, both with beasts and with birds, and the hangings all of 
silk. And besides he had made them make in that garden many 
beautiful fountains which corresponded on different sides of these 
palaces, and all these had little conduits there . . . through some of 
which it was seen ran wine and through some milk and through 
some honey and through some the clearest water. There were set 
to dwell ladies and damsels the most beautiful in the world, who 
all knew very well how to play on all instruments and sing 
tunefully and sweetly dance better than other women of this 
world round these fountains . . . Their duty was to furnish the 
young men who were put there with all delights and pleasures. 
There were plenty of garments, couches, food, and all things 
which can be desired. No sad thing was spoken of there, nor was 
it lawful to have time for anything but play, love, and pleasure. 
And these damsels most beautifully dressed in gold and silk were 
seen going sporting continually through the garden and through 
the palaces; for the women who waited on them remained shut up 
and were never seen abroad in the air. And the Old Man made his 
men understand that in that garden was Paradise. And for this 
reason he had it made in such a way, that Mahomet in his time 
made the Saracens understand about it that those who did his will 
should all when they died go to Paradise where they would find all 
the delights and pleasures of the world and will have there as 
many fair women as they wish at their pleasure and that they will 
find there beautiful gardens and full of rivers which run separately 
in fullness of wine and of milk and of honey and of water, in the 
same way as that of the Old Man; and therefore had he made 
them make that garden like Paradise of which Mahomet had 
spoken to the Saracens. And therefore the Saracens of that 
country believe truly that that garden is Paradise, because of its 
beauty and delectable pleasure. He wished to give them to 
understand that he was a prophet and companion of Mahomet, 
and that he could make whoever he wished go into the said 
Paradise. 
And into this garden entered no man ever except only those 
base men of evil life whom he wished to make satellites and 
Assassins. Because he had indeed a castle at the entry of that 
garden at the mouth of the valley so very strong and impregnable 
that he was not afraid of a man in the world; and it could be 
entered by a secret way; and it was very carefully guarded, and in 
other parts it was not possible to enter into this garden but only 

Origins and Early Formation of the Legends

there. And the Old Man kept with him at his court all the young 
men of the inhabitants of those mountains of the country from 
twelve years to twenty; they were those who seemed to wish to be 
men of arms and brave and valiant, who knew well the hearsay, 
according as Mahomet their most unhappy prophet had told 
them, that their Paradise was made in such manner as I have told 
you, and so they believed in truth as Saracens believe it. And every 
day he preached to them of this garden of Mahomet, and how he 
was able to make them go therein. And what shall I tell you about 
it? Sometimes the Old Man, when he wished to kill any lord who 
made war or was his enemy, made them put some of these youths 
into that Paradise by fours and sixes and by tens or twelves and by 
twenties together just as he wished, in this way. For he had opium 
to drink given them by which they fell asleep and as if half dead 
immediately as soon as they had drunk it, and they slept quite 
three days and three nights. Then he had them taken in this sleep 
and put into that garden of his, into different rooms of the said 
palaces, and there made them wake, and they found themselves 
there. 
Relating yet further details on how the Old Man of the Mountain 
trained his Assassins to become perfectly obedient, Marco Polo states 
that 
and when the youths were waked up and they find themselves in 
there and see themselves in so fine a place and they see all these 
things which I have told you, made just as the law of Mahomet 
says . . . they believe that they are most truly in Paradise. And the 
ladies and the damsels stayed with them all day playing and 
singing and causing great enjoyment, and they did with them as 
they pleased, so that these youths had all that they wished, and 
never will they go out from thence of their own will. 
And the Old Man lord, of whom I have told you, holds his 
court very beautiful and great and lives very nobly, and makes 
those simple people of the mountains who are about him believe 
that it is so as I have said and that he is a great prophet, and so 
they all truly believe . . . And after four or five days when the Old 
Man wishes any of them his Assassins to send to any place and to 
have any man killed, then he has the drink of opium given again 
to as many as pleases him of these youths to make them sleep, and 
when they are asleep he has them taken into his palace which was 

outside the garden. And when these youths are awaked and they 
find themselves out of their garden in that castle in the palace, 
they make great marvel at it and are not very glad of it, that they 
find themselves outside of the Paradise, for from the Paradise from 
which they came they would never of their own will be parted. 
The Old Man makes them come before him, and they go 
immediately before the Old Man and behave themselves very 
humbly towards him and kneel as those who believe that he is a 
great prophet. The Old Man asks them whence they come, and 
those say that (by thy goodness) they come from Paradise. And 
they said indeed in the presence of all that in truth that is Paradise, 
as Mahomet told our ancestors in their law, recounting to them 
all the things which they find there, and how they had great desire 
to return there. And the others who hear this and had not been 
there and have seen none of it wondered extremely to hear it and 
had great wish to go to Paradise, and many had a wish to die that 
they might be able to go there, and much desired that day when 
they should go there. And the Old Man answered them, Son, this 
is by the commandment of our prophet Mahomet, that whoever 
defends his servant he will grant to him Paradise; and if thou art 
obedient to me thou shalt have this favour. Through this means he 
had so inspirited all his people to die that they might go to 
Paradise that he whom the Old Man ordered to go to die for his 
name reckoned himself happy, with sure hope of deserving to go 
to Paradise, so that as many lords or others as were enemies of the 
said Old Man were killed with these followers and Assassins, 
because none feared death if only he could do the commandment 
and will of the said Old Man, and they exposed themselves like 
madmen to every manifest danger, wishing to die together with 
the king's enemy and despising the present life. And for this 
reason he was feared in all those countries as a tyrant. 
And when the Old Man wished to have any lord or any other 
man killed he took some of these his Assassins and sends them 
where he wished, and told them that he wished to send them 
carried by his angels to Paradise, and that they go to kill such a 
man, and if they should die that they will go immediately to 
Paradise. Those to whom this was commanded by the Old Man 
did it very willingly more than anything that they could do; and 
they went and did all that the Old Man commanded them for the 
great desire that they had that they might come back to Paradise. 
And in this way no man escaped who was not killed when the Old 
Man of the Mountain wished. 

Origins and Early Formation of the Legends 
At the end of Marco Polo's account, it is explained that the Old Man 
had had two deputies in Damascus and Kurdistan who observed all his 
manners and customs. And that the end of the Old Man of the 
Mountain, known as Alaodin, came when, after being besieged for 
three years, he with all his men and all those Assassins were killed by 
the Mongols who also destroyed his castle and its garden of paradise. 
Marco Polo's description of the Old Man of the Mountain and his 
Assassins represents the most elaborate synthesis of the Assassin 
legends; only the death-leap legend is absent here. He added his own 
original contribution in the form of the Old Man of the Mountain's 
secret 'garden of paradise'. According to Marco Polo, the Old Man had 
specially designed this garden at his residence for the sole purpose of 
deceiving the would-be fida'is, because the otherworldly paradise 
promised to them as a reward was nothing but a deception. Thus, the 
training of the fida'is involved a most crucial last phase in which the 
misguided and duped youngsters spent a brief time in the garden of 
paradise, where they became deeply addicted to various bodily 
pleasures procured for them in a most sumptuous manner. In this 
account, the hashish connection or legend is given a role subservient to 
that of the 'paradise legend', which itself now appears essentially in a 
terrestrial form. The fida'is, rather than being deluded with hallucinat- 
ory dreams of paradise as in Arnold of Liibeck's account, are actually 
put to sleep under the influence of opium or some such drug while 
being carried to and from the garden of paradise. This secret garden 
bears a close resemblance to the Paradise described in the Quran and 
promised by Mahomet (Prophet Muhammad) to pious believers. 
Indeed, according to Marco Polo, the Old Man styled himself closely 
on the pattern established by the Prophet in order to enhance the 
appeal of his mischievous machinations. 
In sum, in Marco Polo's account, the fida'is' hope for gaining the 
otherworldly paradise, rooted in reality, is completely transformed into 
a desire for perpetually enjoying a variety of carnal delights in this 
world. The fida'is become the devotees of the Old Man simply because 
they wish to return to that 'garden', where they had intensely, but alas 
only too briefly, experienced all the unthinkable joys which could be 
attained only in the otherworldly paradise described in the Quran. 
Having experienced a foretaste of the delights of the Old Man's 
'garden', the fida'is are no longer concerned with the celestial paradise; 
it is the terrestrial 'garden' of delights hidden in the Old Man's 
compound of palaces and castle which they now incessantly seek. 
Admission to this 'garden' is under the stria control of the Old Man, 
who admits for a second time, and indeed for ever, only those 

'Assassins' or fida'is who have actually performed murderous missions 
for him. This is why the 'Assassins' feared no danger and remained 
obedient servants of the Old Man until their death. 
The heritage of the earlier European versions of the Assassin legends 
is clearly manifest in Marco Polo's original synthesis, which soon after 
its compilation began to circulate as the standard and the most popular 
version. The Venetian traveller does not acknowledge any debt to his 
European predecessors, nor does he allude to his own original 
contribution to the Assassin legends. But his account does appear as a 
digressionary note, one of several such digressions in his travelogue, 
implying that he was quoting other sources. In the case of his account 
of the Old Man of the Mountain and his Assassins, Marco Polo claims 
to have heard the tale in Persia from some local informants. At any 
rate, with Marco Polo, the scene of the Assassin legends, which had 
hitherto developed only in connection with the Syrian Nizaris, was 
transposed to Persia; and the legends were now recounted for the first 
time also in reference to the Persian Nizari community of the Alamut 
period. Furthermore, it is important to bear in mind that this important 
innovation received the endorsement of the renowned Venetian 
traveller, whose 'eyewitness' accounts of the Asian kingdoms and 
events were taken rather seriously by his European readers. 
It is knovbn that Marco Polo passed through southern Khurasan in 
eastern Persia, the former Nizari territory of Quhistan, on his way to 
China. There he evidently saw a ruined castle, one of many such castles 
which formerly belonged to the Persian Nizaris of that region. 
However, his itinerary did not take him to Alamut, which appears to be 
the castle alluded to in his account. If this account is at all to be 
credited to Marco Polo then it must be assumed that he had heard from 
his Persian informants some details about Alamut and the Persian 
Nizari community of the earlier times, as his account of the 'Assassins' 
is admittedly not based on personal observation. Citing the name of 
Alaodin in reference to a Persian Nizari chief and alluding to the fact 
that the 'Old Man' in Persia had a deputy in Syria, must have been 
among such details picked up by the youthful Marco Polo while passing 
through Persia. But his Old Man Alaodin was in fact Ala al-Din 
Muhammad I11 (1221-55), the penultimate ruler of the Nizari state in 
Persia. The last ruler was Ala al-Din's son Rukn al-Din, who 
surrendered to the Mongols in 1256 and was killed by them a few 
months later in Mongolia. The watchful Juwayni, who visited Alamut 
in 1256 shortly before that fortress was partially demolished by the 
Mongols, did not find any sign of Marco Polo's 'garden' there; nor is 
the existence of any such Isma'ili garden in Persia attested by Rashid 

Origins and Early Formation of the Legends 
al-Din or any other Muslim source. However, Juwayni was greatly 
impressed by the water conduits, cisterns and storage facilities which he 
did find at Alamut. 
It cannot be denied that Marco Polo's account bears a distinctly 
European imprint, revealing the influences of different traditions which 
are ultimately traceable to Burchard of Strassburg, Arnold of Liibeck 
and James of Vitry. Therefore, it seems that Marco Polo knowingly 
mixed the information he had gathered some 30 years earlier in Persia, 
concerning the Nizari chief there, with the Assassin legends then 
circulating in Europe in connection with the Syrian Nizaris; legends 
which he must have heard in Venice after returning from his travels in 
1295. It is also possible that Marco Polo may have added the account 
of the Old Man and his Assassins to one or more manuscripts of his 
travelogue after leaving his Genoa prison; as noted, he did in fact make 
such revisions and emendations during the last 20 years of his life. 
Rustichello and other scribes, too, may have played a part in this 
connection. All this points to the conclusion that the Venetian traveller 
could not have heard his account in its entirety from his Persian 
informants. There are further proofs for this inference, aside from the 
fact that many essential points of his account are traceable to European 
antecedents developed in connection with the Syrian Nizaris. 
Marco Polo, like William of Rubruck before him, uses corrupted 
forms of the name 'Mulhid' (plural, 'Malahida'), such as 'Mulecte' and 
'Mulehet', in reference to the Persian Nizaris in general, as the 
contemporary Muslim opponents of the Nizaris called them in Persia. 
Thus, in the introductory sentences to his account he says: 
Mulecte is a country where, as is told, a certain very evil prince 
who was called the Old Man of the Mountain used to live long 
ago; in which country heretics according to the Saracen law used 
to dwell. For this name of Mulecte means to say a place where 
heretics stay, in the tongue of Saracens. And from the said place 
the men are called Mulehetici, that is heretics of their law, like 
Patarini among the Chritians.Marco Polo also adopts the name 'Assassin', which appears in 
different forms in his manuscripts, such as the Italian variant 'Asciscin', 
as an appellation for the Persian fida'is, the Old Man's Assassins. As 
noted, the term Assassins had originally acquired currency in the 
Crusader circles in reference to the Syrian Nizaris; and the term had 
been derived from the variants of the word hashishi used abusively, in 

the Arabic language, to designate the Nizaris. However, hashishi or its 
different variants had never gained popularity in the Persian language 
or in Persia, where the Nizaris were commonly called malahida by their 
Muslim opponents. Therefore, Marco Polo could not have heard the 
name 'Assassins' from his Persian informants. 
There is also Marco Polo's curious application of the title of the 'Old 
Man of the Mountain' to the Persian Nizari chief. This title, as noted, 
had been utilized by the Franks in reference to the Nizari chief in Syria. 
The Syrian Nizaris themselves, but not their Persian co-religionists, did 
evidently refer to their local leader with the common Muslim term of 
respect shaykh, lord or master, also having the secondary meaning of 
'old man' or 'elder'. However, as Bernard Lewis has observed,34 the 
Crusaders rendered this term into Latin, old French and Italian on the 
basis of its secondary meaning of 'old man' as vetus, vetulus, senex, 
viel, veglio, etc., rather than by its more relevant equivalents such as 
senior, segnors and dominus. Furthermore, this erroneous rendition of 
shaykh was linked with the mountain fortresses in which the Syrian 
Nizari leader lived, resulting in full titles such as 'Vetus de Montanis', 
or 'Vie1 de la Montaigne', meaning the 'Old Man of the Mountain'. 
Thus, it seems that these titles were coined, in reference to the Syrian 
Nizari chief, by the Crusaders themselves, because their full Arabic 
equivalent, namely 'Shaykh al-Jabal', has not been found in any 
contemporary Arabic or Persian source. The Spanish rabbi and traveller 
Benjamin of Tudela, who passed through Syria in 1167, speaks of the 
Syrian Nizari chief as 'Shaykh al-Hashishin', adding that he is known 
as their elder (ae n ) .'  
It is, therefore, safe to assume that the Arabic 
title of 'Shaykh al-Jabal', found in some modern historical novels, 
represents an Arabic translation from the mediaeval and later European 
equivalents of this title, coined and used by the Crusaders and their 
occidental chroniclers. At any rate, Marco Polo could not have heard 
the title 'Old Man of the Mountain' in Persia where neither the Nizaris 
nor their contemporary opponents used titles such as shaykh or shaykh 
al-jabal, or its full Persian equivalent, namely, pir-i kuhistan, in 
reference to the central leader of the Nizari community. 
There is little doubt, then, that Marco Polo's account of the Old Man 
and his Assassins represents an original admixture of some details 
heard in Persia and the Assassin legends then circulating in Europe, to 
which he added his own imaginative component in the form of the Old 
Man's secret garden of paradise. And this 'garden', not found in any 
earlier European source before Marco Polo, was essentially modelled 
on the Quranic description of Paradise then available. Aware of the 
connection between the Persian and Syrian 'Assassins', it seems that 

Origins and Early Formation of the Legends 
Marco Polo, perhaps aided by Rustichello or a later scribe, used the 
opportunity of compiling his travelogue to present his own 'complete' 
version of the Assassin legends, as a digressionary note from his 
itinerary in Persia, where he had seen a ruined castle and had been told 
some local tales about the Nizari Isma'ilis of that country. And he 
relates what he claims to have heard in Persia in 1273, only 17 years 
after the downfall of the Persian Nizari state there, as if the Nizaris and 
their Old Man had by then already become nothing but long forgotten 
memories. 
Marco Polo's travelogue stirred the imagination of his contemporar- 
ies, and by the second half of the fourteenth century numerous 
manuscripts of it in Latin, old French and Italian dialects were 
circulating in Europe. In like manner, his tale of the Old Man's garden 
of paradise soon began to exercise such fascination on European minds 
that it came to overshadow the earlier accounts. Indeed, Marco Polo's 
version of the Assassin legends came to be adopted, to various extents, 
by successive generations of European writers as the standard descrip- 
tion of the 'Assassins'. 
The account of Odoric of Pordenone (d. 1331), the Franciscan friar 
from northern Italy and another famous European traveller who visited 
China during 1323-7, is perhaps the earliest European account of the 
'Assassins' based almost entirely on Marco Polo, even though Odoric 
claims to be relating his own observations and experiences. On his 
return journey to Italy, in 1328 Odoric passed through the Caspian 
coastland in northern Persia, a region he calls Melistorte and by which 
he may have been referring to the Alamut valley. It is in connection 
with this part of his itinerary that Odoric presents his account of the 
Old Man of theo u n t a i n .And in this country there was a certain aged man called Senex de 
Monte [Old Man of the Mountain], who round about two 
mountains had built a wall to enclose the said mountains. Within 
this wall there were the fairest and most crystal foutains 
in the 
whole world: and abcut the said fountains there were most 
beautiful virgins in great number, and goodly horses also, and in a 
word, everything that could be devised for bodily solace and 
delight, and therefore the inhabitants of the country call the same 
place by the name of Paradise. The said old Senex, when he saw 
any proper and valiant young man, he would admit him into his 
paradise. Moreover by certain conduits he makes wine and milk 
to flow abundantly. 
This Senex, when he hath a mind to revenge himself or to slay 

any king or baron, commandeth him that is governor of the said 
paradise, to bring thereunto some of the acquaintance of the said 
king or baron, permitting him a while to take his pleasure therein, 
and then to give him a certain potion being of force to cast him 
into such a slumber as should make him quite void of all sense, 
and so being in a profound sleep to convey him out of his 
paradise: who being awaked, and seeing himself thrust out of the 
paradise would become so sorrowful, that he could not in the 
world devise what to do, or whither to turn him. Then would he 
go unto the foresaid Old Man, beseeching him that he might be 
admitted again into his paradise: who saith unto him, You cannot 
be admitted thither, unless you will slay such or such a man for 
my sake, and if you will give the attempt only, whether you kill 
him or not, I will place you again in paradise, that there you may 
remain always; then would the party without fail put the same in 
execution, endeavouring to murder all those against whom the 
said Old Man had conceived any hatred. And therefore all the 
kings of the East stood in awe of the said Old Man, and gave unto 
him great tribute. 
And when the Tartars had subdued a great part of the world, 
they came unto the said Old Man, and took from him the custody 
of his paradise: who being incensed thereat, sent abroad diverse 
desperate and resolute persons out of his forenamed paradise, and 
caused many of the Tartarian nobles to be slain. The Tartars 
seeing this, went and besieged the city wherein the said Old Man 
was, took him, and put him to a most cruel and ignominious 
death. 
It is interesting to note that the Assassin legends also appear, in a 
version closely modelled on Marco Polo's account, in a portion of a 
curious historical novel in Arabic which contains an anachronistic 
biography of the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim (996-1021). In 1813, the 
Austrian orientalist Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall announced his 
discovery, at the Imperial Library (now National Library) in Vienna, of 
the unique manuscript of this novel, entitled the Sirat amir al-mu'minin 
al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, and he published the fragment containing the 
Assassin legends together with its French translation in a short notice.37 
The authorship of this work, completed in 1430, had been wrongly but 
deliberately attributed to the famous Muslim biographer Ibn Khallikan 
(d. 1282), probably in order to enhance its prestige and circulation. 
This novel was probably written in Syria some time in the late Mamluk 
period, by a local Sunni Muslim or more probably an Arab Christian, 

Origins and Early Formation of the Legends 
who was familiar with the Assassin legends, especially the version 
handed down by Marco Polo and Odoric of Pordenone. 
According to this novel, a certain Isma'il, the leader of the Isma'ilis, 
once landed at Tripoli, laden with plundered jewels and surrounded by 
fidawis (fida'is). Subsequently, he went to Masyaf, in Syria, where he 
was received most hospitably by the inhabitants of the castles and 
fortresses of that region. There, in order to win more fidawis, he built a 
vast garden with water conduits, and constructed a magnificent four- 
storey pavilion in its midst. The windows of the pavilion were painted 
with stars of gold and silver, and its rooms filled with luxuries. This 
was the retreat of the finely dressed and perfumed young slaves 
(mamluks) of both sexes he had brought with him from Egypt. He filled 
the garden with all types of beautiful plants, fruits and flowers, and 
with animals and birds. Isma'il also had a two-storey house built for 
himself there, whence secret passages led to the garden which was all 
enclosed with walls. In his house, Isma'il entertained his people all day 
long. And in the evening, he would choose some young men, whose 
firmness of character had impressed him, to sit by his side. While 
talking to these young men about the excellent qualities of the imam Ali 
he would secretly give them bang (bani), or some such intoxicating 
drug, mixed in their drink, which would soon sink them into a death- 
like sleep. Isma'il would then carry one of the drugged men to the 
garden pavilion, leaving him in the care of the male and female slaves 
who were commanded to fulfil his every desire. When the drugged man 
awoke confused, the slaves assured him that he was indeed in Paradise; 
and that he would return there even after his death; for this place was 
destined for him. The young man would be so overwhelmed by the 
beauty of the pavilion and the delights he experienced there that he 
would no longer know whether he was awake or dreaming. Soon, the 
slaves would tell him that he had been dreaming about Paradise. When 
two hours of the night had gone by, Isma'il would return and make the 
young man pledge silence about his experience in the garden, also 
telling him that he owed his blissful vision to a miracle of Ali. Then 
Isma'il would have delicious dishes served to him in containers of gold 
and silver as well as drinks which were again mixed with bang. As soon 
as the young man fell asleep again, he would be carried out of the 
garden and taken to Isma'il's house where he was assured, after 
waking up, that he had not dreamed but had been really in Paradise. 
He was, furthermore, told that Ali had admitted him among his friends 
and that if he kept his secret and served Isma'il and died a martyr, he 
would received that same place in Paradise permanently; but if he told 
anyone about that secret he would be an enemy of the imam and wculd 

be chased away. This was how Isma'il surrounded himself with 
devoted fidawis until his reputation was established. 
It may be noted that von Hammer-Purgstall, who a few years later 
published his own hostile tract on the Nizaris, took this novel seriously. 
He, in fact, used it in conjunction with Marco Polo's account as 
sufficient evidence that such Nizari gardens of paradise had actually 
existed in both Syria and Persia;38 an inference which should now be 
summarily dismissed as utterly groundless. On the contrary, as the Old 
Man's secret 'garden of paradise' does not appear in any known source 
before Marco Polo, who could not have acquired his information on 
the 'Assassins' from Arabic sources in Syria, it can more plausibly be 
hypothesized that the legend contained in this Arabic novel was itself 
influenced, perhaps directly, by the European Assassin legends, 
especially the versions traceable to Marco Polo and Odoric. The late 
Arabic version in question also attests to the indirect impact that the 
Assassin legends circulating in the Crusader and Christian circles of the 
Latin East may have had on eastern popular lore and literature, 
especially in Syria where the Nizaris had acquired political prominence 
and where the inhabited Nizari fortresses had continued to be a 
reminder of the past glories of the sect. However, it is by no means 
impossible that both the accounts of Marco Polo and the Sira might 
have been at least partially based on a common earlier oriental source 
not related to the Nizaris, such as some of the tales contained in the 
famous Book of a Thousand Nights and a Night. Be that as it may, it is 
not possible at this time to say anything more with any degree of 
certainty regarding the origin of the Assassin legends contained in the 
fictitious Sirat al-Hakzm. 
By the end of the Middle Ages, and indeed until the nineteeth 
century, European knowledge of the Nizari Ismaeilis had not pro- 
gressed much beyond what the Crusaders and their chroniclers had 
transmitted on the subject; and the field continued to be dominated by 
such fanciful impressions and fictitious accounts, including especially 
the Assassin legends. During the Renaissance, the Nizaris were 
occasionally referred to by a traveller or pilgrim to the Holy Land, 
resulting in brief notices that did not contain any new information. For 
instance, the Dominican friar Felix Fabri, who visited the Holy Land 
twice in 1480 and 1484, mentions the 'Assassins' among the peoples of 
the region, and merely reiterates some of the earlier tales; he relates: 
There are there Assassins, who are Mahometans, and are 
exceedingly obedient to their own captain, for they believe that it 
is by obedience alone that they can win happiness hereafter. Their 

Origins and Early Formation of the Legends 
captain causes their young men to be taught diverse languages, 
and sends them out into other kingdoms to serve the kings 
thereof, to the end that, when the time requires it, each king's 
servant may kill him by poison or otherwise. If after slaying a king 
the servant makes good his escape to his own land, he is rewarded 
with honours, riches and dignities; if he is taken and put to death, 
he is worshipped in his own country as a martyr.39 
In the meantime, by the middle of the fourteenth century, the word 
assassin, instead of signifying the name of a sea in Syria, had acquired 
a new meaning in Italian, French and other European languages; it had 
become a common noun describing a professional murderer. The 
earliest European example of this usage, retained to the present day, 
evidently occurred in Italy. The renowned Italian poet Dante (1265- 
1321), in the 19th canto of the Inferno in his La Divina Commedia, 
speaks of the treacherous assassin (le perfido assassin); and the 
Florentine historian Giovanni Villani (d. 1348) relates how the lord of 
Lucca sent 'his assassins' (i suoi assassini) to Pisa to kill an enemy.40 
Thus, it was the methods of struggle associated with the 'Assassins' 
rather than the fidelity and spirit of self-sacrifice of the Nizari Isma'ili 
fida'is that ultimately impressed the Europeans and gave the word 
assassin its new meaning in European languages. With the advent of 
this usage, the origin and significance of the term 'Assassins' was slowly 
forgotten, while the sect continued to arouse some interest in Europe, 
due mainly to the popularity of the Assassin legends. 
The first western monograph devoted entirely to the history of the 
Nizaris was published in France in 1603; its author was a certain Denis 
Lebey de Batilly, a French official at the court of King Henry IV ofrance.' 
The author had become deeply concerned about the revival of 
political murders in Europe, including that of Henry 111 of France at the 
hands of a Jacobin friar, whom he refers to as 'un religieux assasin- 
porte-couteau'. Apprehensive about the activities of such assassins in 
the religious orders of Christendom, the author had set out in 1595 to 
compose a short treatise on the true origin of the word assasin, which 
had then acquired new currency in France, and the history of the sect to 
which it had originally belonged, calling these sectarians 'les anciens 
Assasins'. This work combined in a highly confused and anachronistic 
manner the accounts of a number of occidental sources with Marco 
Polo's narrative, and it did not add any new details to what had been 
known in Europe about the 'Assassins' in the thirteenth century. 
Indeed, by Lebey de Batilly's time the origin of the word assassin had 
long been forgotten in Europe; and his attempt at an etymological 

explanation of the term did not solve the mystery, but it did start a new 
trend of enquiry. Henceforth, an increasing number of European 
philologists and lexicographers began to collect the variants of this 
term occurring in mediaeval occidental sources, such as arsasini, 
assassini and heyssessini, also proposing many new etymlogies.Meanwhile, the Isma'ilis themselves were identified more correctly 
within the broader context of Islam in a pioneering work of western 
Orientalism compiled by d'Herbelot (1625-95). This French orientalist 
showed clearly that the Ismacilis were in fact one of the main seas of 
ShiT Islam, and that the Isma'ilis themselves had been split into two 
main groups, namely, the Isma'ilis of Africa and Egypt (the Fatimids), 
and those of Asia (also called 'Malahida'), centred at Alamut and 
founded by Hasan Sabbah.43 By the eighteenth century, many strange 
etymologies of the term 'Assassin' had become available, while the 
sectarians had received a few more notices from the pens of travellers 
and missionaries to the East. The utterly confused picture of the Nizaris 
then circulating in Europe is well reflected in two memoirs read in 1743 
by a French scholar, Camille Falconet (1671-1762), before the 
Acadimie Royale des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres. In these memoirs, 
published in 1751 in Paris, Falconet reviewed the notices of his 
European predecessors, including those of Benjamin of Tudela, William 
of Tyre, Arnold of Liibeck, James of Vitry as well as Marco Polo, and 
then presented his own brief account of the history and doctrines of the 
Persian and Syrian 'Assassins', an account permeated with erroneous 
statements and the Assassin legends; he also proposed yet another 
absurd etymology of the name 'ssassin'."It 'remained for Silvestre de Sacy (1758-1838), the doyen of 
nineteenth-century orientalists, finally to solve the mystery of the name 
'Assassin'. In a Memoir, translated for the first time into English in the 
Appendix to this book, he showed, once and for all, that the word 
assassin was connected with the Arabic word hashish. He cited Arabic 
texts, notably by the Syrian historian Abu Shama (1203-67), in which 
the Nizaris are called 'Hashishi' (plural, 'Hashishiyya'). In this famous 
Memoir, de Sacy also produced what may be regarded as the first 
scholarly account of the Nizari Isma'ilis in modern times, utilizing all 
the major occidental studies as well as a number of Muslim chronicles 
then available in Paris. However, in conjecturing why the Nizaris had 
been called 'Hashishiyya', de Sacy partially endorsed the Assassin 
legends, which under his authority were now reintroduced into the 
orientalist circles of Europe. 
It was under such circumstances that the mediaeval tales about the 
Nizaris, the Assassin legends, began to reappear in different forms in 

Origins and Early Fornation of the Legends 
the studies of the eminent orientalists of the nineteenth century dealing 
with the Isma'ilis. The most widely read among such studies, published 
in 1818, was a book written by the Austrian orientalist-diplomat 
Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall (1774-1856). In his book, devoted to 
the Nizaris of the Alamut period, von Hammer accepted Marco Polo's 
account in its entirety as well as all the sinister acts and heresies 
attributed to the Nizaris. Fully convinced of his scholarship on the 
Nizaris, he found it sufficient to state that 
what the Byzantines, the Crusaders, and Marco Polo related of 
them, was long considered a groundless legend, and an oriental 
fiction. The narrations of the latter have not been less doubted 
and oppugned, than the traditions of Herodotus concerning the 
countries and nations of antiquity. The more, however, the east is 
opened by the study of languages and by travel, the greater 
confirmation do these venerable records of history and geography 
receive; and the veracity of the father of modern travel, like that 
of the father of ancient history, only shines with greater lustre.4s 
That von Hammer should have subscribed to such a fanciful and 
hostile view concerning the Nizaris is not, however, surprising, because 
his narrative was in fact based on what Crusader chroniclers and 
mediaeval Sunni authors had gathered or fabricated on the subject. It is 
also worthy of note that von Hammer's book achieved great success in 
Europe; it was soon translated into French and English and continued 
to be utilized, until recent decades, as the standard interpretation of the 
mediaeval Nizari history. 
The Assassin legends, thus, defied dispellment by the scientific 
Orientalism that had begun in Europe during the nineteenth century. In 
the East, too, a host of tales on the Nizaris, some drawing closely on 
European antecedents, had acquired wide popularity through a number 
of historical novels. These legends with forgotten origins were now 
accepted, to various degrees, also by the Muslims themselves, as factual 
descriptions of some of the secret practices of the mediaeval Nizaris; 
after all they had been circulating for more than seven centuries. 
In the meantime, the general progress in Islamic studies, together 
with the recovery and study of a large number of authentic Isma'ili 
sources, was preparing the ground for the initiation of modern 
scholarship in Isma'ili studies. These Isma'ili manuscript sources had 
hitherto been guarded secretly in many private collections in Yaman, 
India, Persia, Syria and Central Asia. Many of these Isma'ili texts have 
now been critically edited, published and studied. Modern progress in 

IsmaTli studies, which has continued unabated since the 1930s, has 
already necessitated drastic revisions of our ideas concerning the true 
nature of Isma'ili history and thought during mediaeval times; it has 
also made it possible for scholars to evaluate critically different 
categories of non-Isma'ili sources dealing with the Isma'ilis, including 
the Crusaders' sources. 
The breakthrough in Isma'ili studies has been particularly rewarding 
in the case of the Nizaris of the Alamut period, whose history had been 
shrouded in so much mystery and obscurity, long providing a suitable 
ground for imaginative tales and legends. It is, indeed, due to the 
modern revaluation of the Nizaris, resulting mainly from the pioneering 
studies of Wladimir Ivanow (1886-1970), Marshall G.S. Hodgson 
(1922-68) and Bernard Lewis, that the Nizaris of the Alamut period 
who patronized learning and spiritualized their mission can no longer 
be judged as an order of drugged Assassins trained for senseless murder 
and mischief. 
Rooted in fear, hostility, ignorance and fantasy, however, the exotic 
tales of hashish, daggers and earthly gardens of paradise, have proved 
too sensational to be totally relegated to the domain of fiction by more 
sober investigations of modern times. That such legends have continued 
to fire the'popular imagination of so many generations, and that they 
are still believed in many quarters, attest to the unfortunate fact that in 
both western and eastern societies the boundaries between fact and 
fiction, and reality and fantasy, are not always clearly definable. Now, 
finally, the time has come to recognize, once and for all, that the 
Assassin legends are no more than absurd myths; the products of 
ignorant, hostile 'imagination', and not desewing of any serious 
consideration; even though they have circulated for centuries as reliable 
narratives. Could the Nizari fida'is really have been the gullible 
characters portrayed in these legends; the blind devotees of a deceitful 
leader who easily made them addicted to hedonistic pleasures and then 
demanded of them nothing less than self-sacrifice for his own 
diabolically selfish motives? And how truthful. an image could this 
possibly be of Hasan Sabbah, the founder of the Nizari revolutionary 
movement? Hasan Sabbah was an austere and highly pious Muslim 
who in the 30 years of his leadership never set foot outside the Alamut 
castle, did not hesitate to execute his own son when he was accused of 
drinking wine, and sent his wife and daughters to live permanently in 
another distant fortress where they were to earn their simple life by 
spinning. It was on the basis of a Shi'i ideology and such harsh 
principles that he founded and directed an independent movement and 
a cohesive territorial state in the midst of a highly hostile ambience. 

Origins and Early Formation of the Legends 
The challenge posed to the existing order by Hasan Sabbah and 
retained by other Nizari leaders in Persia and Syria did naturally call 
forth a campaign, both military and literary, against the Nizaris who 
already had been targeted as Isma'ilis for the hostility of Muslim 
society at large. And in time, the anti-Isma'ili traditions of the 
Muslims, in which the myths of the earlier Isma'ilis had been rooted, 
found their full 'imaginative' development in the Assassin legends of the 
Crusaders, who did not know much about Islam and knew even less 
about the Nizaris. In a sense, then, the Assassin legends were generated 
as a result of an extraordinary type of tacit cooperation between the 
Christians and the Muslims during Crusader times. 
It was, thus, that a mythical journey started by Ibn Rizam at 
Baghdad was eventually completed, via China, Persia, Syria and many 
other lands, by Marco Polo in a Genoa prison; and the anti-Ismaeili 
'black legend' of the Muslim authors found its successor in the 
'Assassin legends' of the Christian Crusaders. The Assassin legends, 
lacking in historicity, have indeed had a fascinating mythical ancestry 
and history.

Appendix: 
Silvestre de Sacy's Memoir 
on the 'Assassins' 
Translated by Azizeh Azodi 
Edited and introduced by Farhad Daftary 

Introductory Note 
Baron Antoine Isaac Silvestre de Sacy was the most eminent orientalist 
of the nineteenth century and, indeed, the founder of modem 
Orientalism in Europe. Through his scholarship and distinguished 
career, de Sacy's name is associated with almost every field of oriental 
studies; and through a wide circle of students, disciples and correspon- 
dents, he also acquired the distinction of being the teacher or mentor of 
the most prominent orientalists of his time.' 
Born in Paris on 21 September 1758, de Sacy was privately tutored at 
a Benedictine abbey, where he initially studied Classics. Later, while 
training as a Biblical scholar, he became interested in studying the 
Orient. It did not take de Sacy long to master a rare combination of 
ancient and modern oriental languages, including Syriac, Chaldean, 
Hebrew, Arabic and Persian. By the age of 30, he had concerned 
himself with every sacred and profane aspect of the Orient, including its 
geography, ancient monuments and inscriptions, history, religions and 
literature. He published pioneering studies in all these fields, many of 
them long memoirs, anthologies and critical editions of original texts. 
In particular, de Sacy's mastery of Arabic and Persian remained 
unrivalled in the Europe of his time; and he composed a number of 
textbooks, chrestomathies and books of grammar for these languages 
which provided the needed foundations for the initiation of their 
scientific study in Europe. 
De Sacy became the first professor of Arabic in the &ole des Langues 
Orientales Vivantes on the establishment of that important School of 
Oriental Languages in 1795, and in 1806 he was appointed to the new 
chair of Persian at the Collige de France; later, he became the director 
of both these institutions, and the president and permanent secretary of 
the Academie des Inscriptions, as well as the curator of oriental 
manuscripts at the Bibliothique Royale. He was one of the founders of 

the Sociiite Asiatique and was nominated as its first president when this, 
the oldest of the European oriental societies, was established in 1822; 
he also involved himself in the redaction of the society's Journal 
Asiatique, in which many of his own shorter studies appeared. Earlier, 
de Sacy had actively supported the publication of the Fundgruben des 
Orients, the first oriental periodical in Europe which appeared during 
1809-18. Silvestre de Sacy's scholarship and eminence were fully 
recognized in his lifetime. In 1832, he was made a new peer of France, 
and was a grand officer of the Liigion d'Honneur, an honour then 
recently instituted by Napoliion Bonaparte; he was also the recipient of 
many foreign honours and titles. He died on 21 February 1838 and was 
buried in the P2re Lachaise cemetery in Paris. 
De Sacy maintained a lifelong interest in investigating the religion of 
the Druzes, and this kindled his original interest in studying the history 
of the Ismaeilis, required as background knowledge for a better 
understanding of the origins of the Druze movement. What was to 
become known as the Dmze religion, it may be recalled, was initially an 
Isma'ili schismatic movement, organized during the final years of the 
Fatimid caliph al-Hakim's reign (996-1021) by a few dissident ddis 
who propounded a number of extremist doctrines, including especially 
al-Hakim': divinity. But in time, the Druzes came to represent a 
separate religious community, beyond the confines of Ismacilism or 
perhaps even Shi'i Islam. 
De Sacy's study of the Druzes dated back to the early 1790s, the 
years of the French Revolution when he temporarily retreated to his 
country house outside Paris. As in other areas of his scholarly 
endeavours, de Sacy began his study of the Druzes on the basis of their 
own literature, a sacred scripture comprised mainly of the writings and 
letters of the founders of the Druze religion, notably Hamza and al- 
Muqtana. Such Druze texts, unlike those of the Isma'ilis, had been 
available in Europe since 1700, when a Syrian physician had come to 
France and presented King Louis XIV (1643-1715) with a collection of 
four Druze manuscripts. De Sacy's first contact with Druze literature 
was, in fact, through the same four manuscripts, which he translated 
from Arabic into French, during his years of seclusion outside Paris. 
Henceforth, he devoted himself to studying the literature and doctrines 
of the Druzes. De Sacy's scholarship on the Druzes eventually 
culminated, after some 40 years and several memoirs and shorter 
studies, in his monumental Exposi de la religion des Druzes, a two- 
volume work published in 1838, the last year of his life. One of de 
Sacy's principal. works, this remains the classic treatment of the early 

Introductory Note 
history and doctrines of the Druzes; it also describes the Druze 
literature then available in European libraries. 
In the long introduction to his Expcsi, de Sacy also elaborated his 
views on the early history and doctrines of the Ismacili movement, 
including what he had been able to gather on the   arm at is.^ Relying 
exclusively on the writings of Sunni authors, however, he naturally 
espoused their anti-Isma'ili stance. In particular, he adopted the 
polemical 'black legend' concerning the origins of Isma'ilism. This 
legend, it will be recalled, had been put into circulation by Ibn Rizam 
and Akhu Muhsin, whose anti-Isma'ili polemics had been fragmentar- 
ily preserved by a few later authors, notably al-Nuwayri. By drawing 
extensively on al-Nuwayri's historical work, then available in manu- 
script form at the Bibliothtque Royale, de Sacy, too, presented the 
controversial Abd Allah b. Maymun al-Qaddah as the real founder of 
Isma'ilism. Furthermore, he reiterated al-Nuwayri's nine-stage initia- 
tion process into Isma'ili religion, leading allegedly to atheim.De Sacy's defective study of the Isma'ilis did, however, lead to an 
important etymological discovery. It was due to his combined interest 
in Isma'ilism and philology that de Sacy finally solved, after many 
abortive attempts of earlier European scholars, the mystery of the name 
'Assassin'. De Sacy prepared an important Memoir on the 'Assassins' 
and on the origin of their name, which he read before the Institut de 
France in 1809;and he had its full version published later in 1818.' 
This full version of de Sacy's Memoir has been translated for the first 
time into English in this Appendix. Suffice it to say that in this Memoir, 
de Sacy examined and rejected all the previous etymological explana- 
tions, and then showed that the variant forms of the word assassin 
occurring in base-Latin documents of the Crusaders and in different 
European languages, were connected with the Arabic word hashish. He 
further suggested that all these variant forms, such as assissini, 
assassini, etc., were derived from two alternative Arabic forms, namely, 
hashishi (plural, hashishiyya and hashishiyyin or hashishin) and 
hashshash (plural, hashshashin). In support of his hypothesis, de Sacy 
was able to cite Arabic texts, notably by the Syrian chronicler Abu 
Shama, in which the Nizari Isma'ilis were in fact called 'Hashishi' 
(plural, 'Hashishiyya'), but he could not produce similar substantiating 
quotations for the second Arabic form of his suggested etymology, 
namely hashshash (hashshashin), a more modem word and the 
common term for a hashish taker. Therefore, as B. Lewis has argued, 
the second part of de Sacy's etymological explanation, with all that it 
implies, must be rejeted.In his Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins, de Sacy also included 

a brief history of the Nizaris of Persia and Syria during the Alamut 
period, summarizing all that he had been able to extract from the 
Islamic sources and the chronicles of the Crusaders. In this pioneering 
study, de Sacy definitely placed the 'Assassins' in the frame of Islamic 
history as Nizari Isma'ilis, ending numerous fanciful hypotheses, 
proposed by European authors since the times of the Crusaders. But he 
himself fell under the spell of the 'Assassin legends' transmitted through 
the occidental sources. As a result, in conjecturing on the reason why 
the Nizaris had been called 'Hashishis', de Sacy, too, arrived at the 
conclusion that the Nizaris must have actually used hashish, or a 
hashish-containing potion, in some manner; though he did exclude the 
possibility of any habitual use of this drug by the fida'is. As explained 
in his Memoir, de Sacy believed that hashish, or an electuary of it, was 
at the time the secret possession of the Nizari chief, who used it 
sparingly and in a regulated manner on the fida'is to procure them with 
ecstatic dreams of Paradise, a foretaste of the eternal bliss that awaited 
them if they obeyed their chief. Thus, de Sacy linked his etymological 
explanation to the tales told by the occidental authors of mediaeval 
times, notably Arnold of Liibeck, Marco Polo and Odoric of Por- 
denone, of how the young fida'is were deluded by their scheming chief. 
De Sacy's Memoir proved to be a landmark in Nizari studies; and it 
did pave the ground for a few more 'scholarly' writings on the subject 
by the later orientalists, notablytienne M. Quatremire (1782-1857) 
and Charles F. Defrkmery (1822-83); but it did lend the seal of 
approval of this doyen of nineteenth-century orientalists to the Assassin 
legends. That an eminent savant of the calibre of Silvestre de Sacy 
should so readily have fallen victim. to the twin influences of the anti- 
Isma'ili campaign of the Sunni polemicists and the 'Assassin' fantasies 
of the Crusaders is once again a reminder of how the Isma'ilis had been 
studied, until recent times, almost exclusively on the basis of evidence 
collected or fabricated by their enemies and by ignorant observers.

Memoir on the Dynasty 
of the Assassins, 
and on the Etymology of 
their Name * 
by Silvestre de Sacy 
In a work I lately submitted to the Class,' I gave a detailed account of 
the doctrines of the Isma'ili sea, going back, as far as possible, to the 
origin of this sect and of the religious or rather philosophical system 
which specifically characterizes it. There is convincing proof that the 
secret doctrine of the Isma'ilis, into which only a small number of 
adepts were initiated, aimed at substituting philosophy for religion, 
reason for faith, and unlimited freedom of thought for the authority of 
revelation. This freedom, or rather this licence, could not long remain a 
simple speculation of the mind; it went to the heart, and its pernicious 
moral influence soon made itself felt. Thus the Isma'ilis had groups 
emerging from their midst who attained all the immorality of which 
their doctrine had laid the foundations, and who shook off not only the 
restraints of faith and public worship, but also those of decency and the 
most sacred laws of nature. What went on during the orgies of the 
Qarmatis, what the Druzes were more than once accused of, what 
certain sects practise even today in Mesopotamia and in some parts of 
Syria, would perhaps have made the original authors of this doctrine 
blush; the authors who, no doubt, had failed to foresee all the 
consequences of their system. 
However, neither the unlimited freedom of thought, which essentially 
formed the ultimate stage of the Isma'ili teachings, nor the licentious- 
ness characterizing several branches of this sect, were common to all 
those who professed the allegorical doctrine and recognized the 
transmission of the imamate to Isma'il, the son of Ja'far Sadiq. Even 
the admission and initiation of new proselytes was carried out in stages

and with great discretion. For as it pursued both a political aim and 
ambitious views, the sect was above all interested in having a large 
number of partisans in all places and among all social classes. So it had 
to adapt itself to the character, the temperament and the prejudices of 
vast numbers: what could be revealed to some would have shocked and 
permanently estranged less daring minds and more easily alarmed 
consciences. As long as the allegorical doctrine could serve as a means 
to intimate the necessity of recognizing the legitimate succession to the 
caliphate in the person of Ali and of the imams issued from his blood 
through Isma'il, the son of Ja'far; and as long as its followers were 
obliged to submit blindly to the commands of the &is or missionaries, 
acting as the ministers and interpreters of the will of the imam, who 
remained hidden under the veils of mystery, waiting for the right time 
to manifest himself, not much trouble was taken to acquaint the new 
convert with further secrets. It is not surprising, therefore, that the 
Isma'ilis were divided into several seas with their doctrines differing in 
various degrees from those of Islam. These were the Qarmatis, the 
Nusayris, the Fatimids or Batinis of Egypt, the Druzes, the Isma'ilis of 
Persia, known by the name of Mulhid (plural, Malahida) or impious, 
and those of Syria, to whom the name Assassins especially applies. 
I have elsewhere shown that the Qarmaas were a branch of the 
Isma'ilis, and that the allegorical doctrine was established in their 
midst with all its consequences. Whence the insurrection against 
authority, the pillage of pilgrim caravans, the desecration of places 
sacred to Islam, the profanation of Mecca, the removal of the Black 
Stone, etc. The Nusayris, who exist even today in the mountains of 
Lebanon are, to all appearances, a branch of the Qarmati factin.The 
Fatimids or Batinis of Egypt consider themselves as Isma'ilis. Their 
dynasty was first founded in Africa, around the end of the third century 
of Hegira, by a ddi of the Qarmatis. However, having attained their 
political aims, Mahdi and his successors realized that they had better 
use a somewhat different language; and, after having preached 
rebellion against the Abbasid caliphs, they began to preach submission 
to authority. The allegorical doctrine also had to be mitigated; for had 
they accepted its consequences, had they abolished public worship and 
eliminated prayer, fasting and pilgrimage, they would have outraged 
people and overthrown by their own hands the throne they had just 
ascended. Acting in their own interests, they thus became tolerant, 
followed external practices and protected the hierarchy; and they 
contented themselves with introducing in Egypt, after their conquest, a 
few of the external signs characterizing the Shi'ites or partisans of Ali, 
whom Arab historians call shl'ar al-tashayyu, the devotees of Shr'ism. 

But although they outwardly acted in conformance with the doctrine 
and customs accepted by the common Muslims and founded on the 
letter of the Koran and on tradition, they nevertheless preserved and 
secretly propagated their allegorical doctrine. They had their da'is, 
headed by the supreme chief of the sea, called da'i al-ducat or Da'i of 
&is, who often combined these functions with those of the qadi al- 
qudat or supreme judge. Meetings of the sea were regularly held once 
or twice a week in the palace of the caliphs. The sect propagated itself 
through the admission of new initiates, men and women. At each 
meeting, mystical instructions, called the Lectures of Wisdom, majalis 
al-hikma, were read; these were specifically composed for the purpose, 
read and approved at the special reunions of the da'is, which also took 
place in the palace, and then submitted to the caliph for his approval. 
All these practices belonged to the sea of the Isma'ilis and that of the 
Qarmatis3 Besides, various facts conclusively prove that the Qarmatis 
and Fatimids, who stemmed from a common origin, had the same 
doctrine and the same philosophical aim, and actually formed one and 
the same sea, though divded by their political interests. 
In the year 317 of the Hegira, Abu Tahir, the chief of the Qarmatis, 
had flooded Mecca and its holy temple with the blood of pilgrims and 
had removed the Black Stone. He died in 332, and so did his brother 
Abua n s u r ah m a d ;but they had two brothers who succeeded them, 
Abu'l-Qasim Sa'id and Abu'l-Abbas. It was under their government 
that the Black Stone was returned to Mecca. This restitution was 
induced, according to Nuwayri, by a letter from Ubayd Allah, the first 
caliph of the Fatimid dynasty, addressed to the Qarmati chief to 
reproach him for his conduct on this occasion. 
You have justified the reproaches levelled against us, you have 
revealed the secret and the true spirit of our doctrine which leads 
to incredulity and immorality. Unless you restore to the Meccans 
what you took from them, unless you replace the Black Stone, and 
unless you return the cloth that covered the Ka'ba, I no longer 
have anything in common with you, neither in this world nor in 
the next. 
Hamza Isfahani, quoted by Reiske in his notes on Abu'l-Fida 
(Abulfedae Annales Moslernici, Vol 2, p 752), reports that Abu Tahir, 
having returned to Hajar after the pillage of Mecca, acknowledged 
Ubayd Allah as his sovereign, had public prayers recited in his name, 
and informed him about them in a letter, but he subsequently ceased 
showing these marks of obedience once he received reproaches and

threats instead of the rewards and expressions of gratitude he had 
expected. 
The Qarmatis had made themselves so feared in the empire of the 
Abbasid caliphs through their repeated forays in Syria, that they were 
granted, at the time of the Ikhshidid emirs who reigned in Egypt and 
Syria in the name of the caliphs, an annual tribute of 300,000 gold 
coins to be disbursed by the public treasury of Damascus. When Jawhar 
had subjugated Egypt for the Fatimids, and when Syria was also 
conquered for them by another general, Ja'far bin Fallah, the Qarmatis 
found this a favourable occasion to expand their power. Hasan, the son 
of Abu Mansur Ahmad, who was ,then governing them, first advanced 
to Kufa, with the intention of entering Syria.' Hatred against the 
Fatimids prompted Bakhtiyar, a prince of the Buwayhid or Buyid 
family, who at the time held the office of amir al-umara in Baghdad, to 
support his venture by giving him all the arms of the Baghdad arsenal 
and 400,000 gold coins to be paid by Abu Taghlib, son of Nasir al- 
Dawla of the Hamdan family. Abu Taghlib, who welcomed this 
opportunity to avenge himself for the insulting and threatening tone in 
which he had been addressed by Ja'far bin Fallah, the general of the 
Fatimids in Syria, paid the 400,000 gold coins to the Qarmati prince, 
and also supplied him with provisions and troops. His army was 
further enlarged by all the soldiers of the Ikhshidids, who had been 
driven out of Egypt and had flooded into Syria and Palestine. Thus 
finding himself at the head of a strong army, Hasan the Qarmati 
advanced to Damascus, of which he gained possession, and, after 
several other conquests, he marched towards Egypt. Jawhar, who was 
the commander there, was greatly alarmed by this move and strongly 
urged Mu'izz, who had not yet left Qayrawan, to come to Egypt. 
Mu'izz actually arrived there in 363; and wrote from there to the 
Qarmati prince, pointing out that they both belonged to the same sect, 
and that it was from the Isma'ilis that the Qarmatis had received their 
doctrine. Hasan, adds the author from whom Nuwayri borrowed this 
story, was well aware that the two sects were one and the same; and, in 
fact, the Isma'ilis and Qarmatis agreed in professing atheism and 
complete licence as regards people and property, and in denying the 
prophetic mission. But even though they agreed about the doctrine, 
when one of the two parties had an advantage over the other it would 
not spare the lives of those who followed the opposing party and would 
show them no mercy. 
Hasan took no heed of Mu'izz's approach; he entered Egypt, went as 
far as Ayn Shams, besieged Cairo and took possession of the moat. The 
defeat of Mu'izz would have been inevitable had he not won over to 

his side one of the chiefs of the Qarmati army, who abandoned the 
latter in the thick of the fight. Hasan was forced to flee. Soon he also 
lost Damascus. After Hasan's death, which occurred in 366, the 
Qarmatis had a few more quarrels with neighbouring princes, until the 
year 375, when they disappeared from history, as it were. Yet I have 
learned from books of the Druzes that they were still ruling in Lahsa in 
422.' 
What I just said about the close links that existed, at least from the 
point of view of a common origin and doctrine, between the Isma'ilis 
of Egypt or Fatimids and Qarmatis, applies with no less certainty to the 
Isma'ilis of Persia and Syria, known by the names of Mulhids and 
Assassins.* It is well known that the Assassins of Syria, who were so 
famous in the history of the Crusades, depended on the Isma'ilis of 
Persia; but not enough is known about the liaisons that existed between 
them and the Fatimids, and it is even possible that this idea was 
abandoned as a result of what one reads about the murder of Amir bi- 
Ahkam Allah, one of these caliphs, who was killed by the Batinis or 
Isma'ilis. 
De Guignes (Histoire des Huns, Book X, Vol 3, pp 221, 222) has 
nevertheless pointed out this connection by saying that Hasan Sabbah, 
the founder of the Isma'ili dynasty of Persia, had spent some time with 
Mustansir billah, the caliph of Egypt, and that the religion he founded 
was somehow related to the sea to which the Fatimids belonged. The 
author of the Tableau gh&al& l'empire Othoman (Vol 1, p 36) also 
mentions this, albeit inaccurately, by saying that Hasan Humayri, the 
founder of the Isma'ili sea in Persia, was a depraved sheikh who, 
having preached in Persia and Syria in favour of the Fatimids of Egypt 
and against the Abbasids of Baghdad, ended up making false 
commentaries on the Koran and founding a new sea. In a dissertation I 
shall mention below, the abbot S. Assemani of Padua also says that 
according to the author of the Nigaristan, Hasan preached in favour of 
the caliphs of Egypt, and against the Abbasids. But these slight 
indications are not sufficient to prove the close relationship that existed 
between the Fatimids of Egypt and the Isma'ilis of Persia. This 
relationship is more clearly pointed out by the author of the Nizam al- 
tawarikh, a chronological summary of the history of the oriental 
dynasties, of which I provided an excerpt in Volume IV of the Notices 
et Extraits des Manuscrits (p 686). This writer says that Mustansir, the 
Fatimid caliph of Egypt, sent Hasan patents making him a governor 
and his lieutenant. 
The history of the dynasty founded by Hasan, which lasted 170 
years, is as yet little known. D'Herbelot, and after him Marigny in his 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
Rkvolutions des Arabes, and de Guignes in the first volume of his 
Histoire des Huns, have listed the succession of princes of this dynasty, 
but with very little detail. The prelate Et. &ode Assemani, in his 
Catalogue des Manuscrits Orientaux de la Bibliothbque des Mkdicis a 
Florence (p 242), also included the succession of these princes, based on 
the chronological tables of the oriental dynasties, written in the Turkish 
language; but he added no facts to it. In my note on the Nizam al- 
tawarikh to which I have already referred, I included what information 
this brief summary offered on that dynasty. And finally, abbot 
S. Assemani of Padua has published, in the June 1806 issue of the 
journal printed in that town and entitled Giornale dell'ltaliana 
letteratura, a dissertation containing a few more details about this 
family. He used the Nigaristan as his source. It all comes to four or five 
pages, and can hardly be said to contribute to an adequate knowledge 
of the history of the Isma'ilis. 
It is easy to make up for the inadequacy of these materials by 
referring to Mirkhwand's Rawdat al-safa, which contains a very long 
and very detailed history of this dynasty, and particularly of its founder 
Hasan bin Sabbah. Adding to that the contributions of Elmacin, Abu'l- 
Fida, Abu'l-Faraj and a few other writers, the progress of this power 
can be traced from its origin to its destruction. 
Mr Falconet, in his two memoirs on the Isma'ilis or Assassins 
published in the collection of the Acadimie des Belles Lettres (Vol 
XVII, pp 127 ff.), has very aptly discussed a number of facts concerning 
this subject. He showed that the Assassins of Syria were a branch of the 
Isma'ilis of the Jibal or of Persia, that the head of the sea, le Vieux de 
la Montagne (the Old Man of the Mountain), lived in Alamut, and that 
the Isma'ilis of Syria came under his jurisdiction. He also discussed the 
origin of the name Assassins: but as he did not know any oriental 
languages, his research was exclusively based on those oriental writers 
of whom printed translations were available, and on a few excerpts 
from Abu'l-Fida communicated to him by de Guignes, who was very 
young at the time. Thus Falconet's work remains very incomplete. 
However, since he rightly established the identity of the Isma'ilis of 
Persia and the Assassins of Syria, I shall not dwell on a discussion of 
this historical point; I shall mainly try to describe the relationship of 
this branch of Isma'ilis with the branch to which the caliphs of Egypt 
belonged; and then I shall proceed to discuss the origin of the name 
Assassins. I shall also add a few observations on the various names 
given to the Isma'ilis by oriental historians. 
The history of the Isma'ilis of Persia provided by Mirkhwand is 
interesting enough to deserve a complete translation. However, as this 

task is extraneous to the work of the Class, I reserve it for the collection 
of the Notices [etxtraits]and will only give a brief outline of their 
beginnings here.'' 
Shahrastani and Ibn Khaldun tell us that the Isma'ilis are divided 
into two branches or seas, or to use their own expression, into two 
preachings, da'wa, an old one and a new one. The old one goes back to 
the period of imam Isma'il, son of Ja'far Sadiq, or rather to that of his 
son Muhammad, around the middle of the third century of the Hegira; 
the new one starts with Hasan bin Sabbah, around the year 483 of the 
same calendar. 
These authors say that each of these two Isma'ili branches has its 
own particular dogmas and tenets, but they both agree on several 
important points forming the essence of their system. Thus all Isma'ilis 
recognize the rights of Ali and of his children after him to the imamate, 
that is, to the sovereign spiritual and temporal power, and consider as 
usurpers all princes who exercised this sovereignty in disregard of the 
rights of Ali's family. Unlike many other sects that are partisans of Ali, 
they do not accept a succession of twelve imams." The imams they 
recognize are seven in number, and the seventh one is Isma'il, son of 
Jacfar Sadiq: this is why they call themselves Isma'ilis. They believe 
that after Isma'il the imamate remained hidden, and that its function 
was filled by obscure personages not known to men: the true faith was 
then entrusted, like a deposit, to the da'is or other ministers until such 
time as the imam reappeared. This manifestation occurred in the person 
of Ubayd Allah, surnamed the Mahdi, who, with the assistance of the 
da'i Abd Allah, first founded the dynasty of the Ubaydite or Fatimid 
caliphs in North Africa. Under the fourth prince of this dynasty, Egypt 
was added to their dominions; it became the seat of power of these 
pontiffs, who rivalled those of Baghdad and had an infinite number of 
partisans in the latter's dominions, where they secretly maintained 
da'is or missionaries, eager to propagate their doctrine and ready to 
take advantage of every opportunity to promote their rights. 
Hasan bin Sabbah was one of these da'is. His father's name was Ali; 
and if he is sometimes called son of Sabbah, or son of Muhammad bin 
Sabbah, it is because he claimed descent from a person who was 
famous for his virtues and for the miracles attributed to him, called 
Muhammad bin Sabbah Humayri [Himyari] . 
Hasan's father, Ali, lived withdrawn from the world and was given 
to mortification, but was thought to harbour opinions that were hardly 
religious and of very doubtful orthodoxy. To ward off such suspicions, 
he sent his son to Nishabur, to study with a sheikh who was well 
known for the pureness of his faith, as well as his enlightened mind and 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
virtues, the imam Muwaffaq Nishaburi. Here Hasan came into close 
contact with a person who was to become very famous under the name 
of Nizam al-Mulk. This connection later brought him the advantage of 
becoming attached to the service of Saljuqid sultan Malikshah, to 
whom he was introduced by his erstwhile fellow-student, who had 
become a vizier under the name of Nizam al-Mulk. He subsequently 
tried to supplant his benefactor; but having failed in this project due to 
the vizier's intrigues and shrewdness, he saw himself obliged to leave 
the court, and retired first to Rey, and then to Ispahan, where he went 
into hiding at the house of the ra'is Abu'l-Fadl. 
Hasan himself said:12 
I was brought up from my youth in the doctrine of the Shi'ites 
who recognize the succession of the twelve imams: I had struck up 
an acquaintance with one of those sectarians called rafiq (I shall 
explain this word below); his name was Amira Darrab. I was 
convinced that the doctrine of the Isma'ili sea corresponded with 
that of the philosophers: so I always argued with Amira when he 
stood up for the IsmaTli sea, or when he attacked my faith. 
Nevertheless these discourses impressed themselves on my mind; 
and having fallen dangerously ill, I came to realize that the 
doctrine of the Isma'ilis was the true one; that the reason I had 
not adopted it was stubbornness; and that, were I to die in this 
condition, I would be hopelessly lost. Having recovered from my 
illness, I became acquainted with another IsmaCli, and then with 
a da'i whom I asked to admit me to the sea. Later, I myself was 
promoted to the rank of da'i and sent to Egypt to enjoy the 
privilege of seeing the imam Mustansir. 
Mustansir, no doubt delighted by a circumstance that could make 
him expand his power in Asia, showered Hasan with honours, without, 
however, admitting him to his presence. The caliph kept abreast of all 
of Hasan's activities and talked about him in such favourable terms 
that everyone believed he would soon rise to the most prominent 
position. At this juncture, there occurred a heated altercation between 
Hasan and the amir al-juyush or commander-in-chief of the caliph's 
armies, who directed the Isma'ili sect, about Mustansir's designation of 
Nizar,I3 one of his sons, as his successor. The caliph had revoked this 
decision, and the amir al-juyush had approved of his doing so.14 Hasan, 
on the other hand, supported the irrevocability of the first designation. 
Mustansir was urged by the amir al-juyush, who may have been jealous 
of Hasan's influence, to have him arrested and imprisoned in the 

Damietta fortress; but, as the caliph was not willing to do so, Hasan's 
enemies put him on board a ship with some Franks and sent him to the 
Maghrib. After a few adventures that seemed something of a miracle, 
Hasan landed in Syria, went to Aleppo, then to Baghdad, and then to 
Khuzistan, Ispahan, and finally to Yazd and Kirman, performing his 
functions as a da'i all along and sparing no efforts for the propagation 
of his sea. He subsequently returned to Ispahan, then went to 
Khuzistan where he spent three years. From there he went to Damghan, 
where he also spent three years, converting many people. Afterwards he 
travelled to Gurgan, and from there by way of Damawand and 
Qazwin, he entered Daylam. He finally settled at Alamut, where he 
spent his time meditating and leading a religious life. 
We need hardly describe the ways in which Hasan bin Sabbah 
managed to seize the fortress of Alamut, a place situated in the Qazwin 
region and belonging to sultan Malikshah. It was governed by a kutwal 
or commandant called Mahdi. In these parts, the preachings of the 
da'is, particularly those of Husayn Qa'ini, had brought about such an 
increase in the number of partisans of the Isma'ili doctrine who 
recognized as their sovereign the imam established in Egypt, that Hasan 
had no difficulty in forcing the kutwal to sell him, for 3000 dinars, a 
stretch of land the size of an ox-hide. But this bargain enabled Hasan, 
who was as shrewd as Dido, to take possession of a vast site comprising 
the entire citadel. He gave Mahdi a draft for 3000 dinars drawn on the 
governor of Girdkuh, who had secretely embraced his party, and forced 
him to leave. Having become master oflamut," he sent the da'i 
Husayn Qa'ini with other rafiqs on a mission to convert and subject 
the peoples of Kuhistan, a country belonging to Khurasan and situated 
near the south-eastern end of this large province. 
Here an important circumstance should be noted. I shall translate 
Mirkhwand's text literally. 
When Hasan, son of Sabbah, became master of Alamut, he 
ordered a canal to be dug, and had water brought from far away 
to the foot of the fortress. He had fruit trees planted outside the 
place and encouraged the inhabitants to cultivate and develop the 
soil. This is how the air of Alamut, which was previously very 
unhealthy, became pure and salubrious. 
Could this not have served to accredit the idea of the delightful 
gardens of the Assassins, which 1 shall mention below? But let us go 
back to the sequence of historical facts. 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
Malikshah sent troops against Hasan, but it was in vain that they 
laid siege to Alamut. Hasan, who at the time had no more than 70 
rafiqs with him, stood his ground against the assailants, and, having 
received a reinforcement of 300 men from outside, he fell upon the 
sultan's troops by night, made a great carnage and took an enormous 
booty. The death of Malikshah, which occurred in the year 485 of the 
Hegira (AD 1092), subsequently contributed to extending and consoli- 
dating Hasan's power. 
Hasan had two sons, whom he killed, one for having drunk wine, the 
other because he was suspected of having been responsible for Husayn 
Qa'ini's assassination. Hasan's aim in doing so was to show everybody 
that he had no intention of establishing a sovereignty which he would 
pass on to his children. He devoted himself with such zeal to 
administering his dominions and gave so much time to replying to the 
questions addressed to him regarding the dogmas of the sea that, 
throughout the 35 years he spent at Alamut, he left his apartment only 
twice to climb to the terrace of his palace, and never set foot outside the 
fortress. 
I shall not go any further with this historical excerpt. Suffice it to say 
that before his death, which happened in 519 of thee g i r a , 'Hasan 
designated as his successor Kiya Buzurg-Ummid, whose descendants, 
under the title of muqaddim, preserved the sovereignty of Alamut and 
of the other places conquered by the Isma'ilis, and that, under the reign 
of Kiya Buzurg-Ummid himself, the Isma'ilis took arms against a 
descendant of Ali, called Abu Hashim, who wanted to be recognized as 
an imam in Gilan. On this occasion, too, Mirkhwand refers to the 
Isma'ilis as rafiqan. 
Let us end with a few events in the history of the Isma'ilis. 
In 498, they pillaged and massacred a caravan near Rey, consisting of 
a group of pilgrims travelling to Mecca from India and the Mawara al- 
Nahr or Transoxania. 
In 500, they suffered a defeat from sultan Malikshah." 
In 502, they almost took possession of Shayzar in Syria. 
The year 51918 saw the death of Hasan, son of Sabbah, who, 
according to Abu'l-Fida, forbade common men to cultivate the 
sciences, and more enlightened men to read the books of ancient 
philosophers. 
The first conquest of the Isma'ilis in Syria was Baniyas; they took 
possession of it in 523.19 
In 525, they captureda sa $ O  
in Syria; this place became their chief 
10cality.' 
In 559, Hasan, the son of Muhammad and grandson of Kiya Buzurg- 

Ummid, abolished all the Islamic practices and, in the name of a hidden 
imam, from whom he claimed to have received a special order to this 
effect, gave his subjects complete freedom to drink wine and to indulge 
in everything that was forbidden by Muslim law. He proclaimed that 
knowledge of the allegorical meaning of these precepts rendered their 
literal observance useless, and thus earned the sea the name of Mulhids 
or impious.22 
According to Mirkhwand and the author of the Nigaristan, Hasan 
reigned for a few years only: he died in 561 (1165), and his son 
Muhammad, who imitated his impiety, reigned for 46 years and died in 
606 (1209).However, according to the author of the Nizam al- 
tawarikh, Hasan reigned for 50 years and died in 607 (1210). It was his 
son whose reign was very short. Depending on which one of these 
accounts we accept, the embassy of the Old Man of the Mountain to 
the King of Jerusalem, Amalric I, coincided either with Hasan's or with 
his son's reign.24 It is thus true, as William of Tyre reports, that the 
prince who sent the embassy had abolished all the practices of the 
Muslim religion, destroyed the mosques, and allowed the consumption 
of wine and pork, as well as incestuous unions. Those who are familiar 
with the books of the Druzes find it easy to believe that this prince may 
have read the holy books of the Christians and conceived the desire, not 
to embrace lchristianity, but to learn more about its doctrine and 
practices. 
Sinan, the head of the Isma'ilis in Syria and the founder of the sea's 
power in that country, died in 588. 
In 608, all the Isma'ilis, both of Syria and of Persia, followed the 
orders of Jalal al-Din Hasan, the emir of Alamut and sixth prince of 
this dynasty, to observe the external signs of the Muslim religion which 
they had abandoned by order of the ancestor of this prince, Hasan, son 
of Muhammad and grandson of Kiya Buzurg-Ummid. 
In 644, ambassadors of Ala al-Din, the emir of the Isma'ilis of 
Persia, attended a couriltai or general assembly of Mongol tribal chiefs 
for the election of a Khan of the Tartars. 
In 668, sultan Baybars entered the Isma'ili territories in Syria and 
captured Masyat from them. 
Finally in 670, this same prince put an end to their power in Syria.2s 
This power had already collapsed in Kuhistan in 653, through the 
submission of the prince of the Isma'ilis, Rukn al-Din Khurshah, to 
Hulagu, the destruction of Alamut, and the massacre of Rukn al-Din's 
family and of a large number ofu l h i d s .When I say that the Isma'ilis were exterminated, both in Persia and 
in Syria, before the end of the seventh century of the Hegira, what I 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
mean is not their sea, but the sovereignty they had founded. They often 
reappear in history at a later period and continue practising their 
profession of assassins which had made them so fearsome. One such 
instance about which oriental historians have handed down to us the 
most ample details is their repeated conspiracy against Qarasunqur. 
This emir, who had been governor or viceroy of Aleppo for the sultan 
of Egypt, Malik al-Nasir Muhammad, son of Qala'un, had been forced 
to leave the dominions of this sultan and take refuge with the Mongols 
of Persia, the descendants of Hulagu, who were at that time under the 
command of Uljaytu Khan, also called Khudabanda. The sultan, who 
resented his being protected from his vengeance, tried several times to 
have him assassinated by Isma'ilis whom he had sent for that purpose. 
On one single occasion, he dispatched 34 of them to this effect. They 
were people living at Masyat, the former capital of the Isma'ilis in 
Syria. Qarasunqur escaped their attempts and resorted to the same 
method, but with equal lack of success, to have the sultan killed. A 
hundred and twenty-four Isma'ili assassins subsequently sent by Malik 
al-Nasir to kill Qarasunqur perished as victims of his vengeance 
without being able to carry out their project. The Isma'ilis still had a 
chief at Masyat, even at that period. For Maqrizi tells us that the sultan 
appealed to him and gave him a large sum of money so that he would 
send him some of his people. In the report about these events, Masyat 
still appears to be the residence and refuge of these Assassins. The 
sultan then negotiated with Qarasunqur and the vizier of the Mongol 
prince and promised not to send any more Isma'ilis to assassinate 
them; but he did not keep his word. He again entrusted the execution 
of his project to an Isma'ili who had been sent to him from Masyat, 
and whom he fed for 34 days before giving him his orders and 
dispatching him, supplying him with enough food and drink for several 
persons each day. This man killed another emir, mistaking him for 
Qarasunqur. Several of these murderers were tortured in vain, they 
never confessed anything. 
The Isma'ili sea still survives today, as I shall mention below. 
I shall now discuss the origin of the name Assassins. 
1 mentioned at the beginning of this Memoir that the Isma'ilis or 
Batinis were known in the histories of the Crusades under the name of 
Assassins. This name was pronounced and written in different ways, 
either, as Falconet says, due to the mistakes of copyists, or because of 
the ignorance of the authors themselves. Among these variants, those 
that -are most authoritative are the following Assassini, Assessini, 
Assissini and Heissessini. The latter, stemming from Arnold of Liibeck, 
has the advantage of keeping the aspirate which the original word must 

have contained, since Benjamin of Tudela writes Hashishin with a heth 
in Hebrew, and since the Greek authors write it with a x (khi), calling 
these sectarians Xasisioi?' Renaudot (Hist. patr. Alex., p 470) also 
writes Hassissini, and sometimes Hassassini; but he does not give the 
etymology of this word?* 
Various etymologies of the word assassins have been suggested. I 
would not have mentioned the opinion of M. de Caseneuve (Diction- 
naire 6tymologique de la langue Franoise, 1750), who proposes to 
derive the name Assassins from the ancient Teutonic word sahs, sachs, 
saehs, meaning cutlass, because this derivation is obviously spurious, 
nothing being less natural than to look for the origin of an oriental 
denomination in the language of the Teutons; however, this scholar 
thought he could prove that the name did not come from the languages 
of Asia and was unknown to the Saracens, quoting as his authority 
William, archbishop of Tyre, who said: Hos tam nostri quam Saraceni 
nescimus unde deducto vocabulo, Assissinos vocant (Gesta Dei per 
Francos, Vol 1, p 994). De Caseneuve obviously reads far too much 
into this passage, in which William admits that he does not know the 
origin of this name, but by no means states that it was unknown to the 
Saracens. 
Court de GCbelin (Dictionnaire . . .) also derives the word assassin 
from the Teatonic sachs; but the same word, signifying the dynasty of 
the Assassins, appears to him to stem from shahi shah, king of kings. 
Th. Hyde (Veterum Persarum religionis historia, p 493), who had 
doubtless never come across the denomination in any Arab author, 
thought that it must be the word hassas derived from the root hassa, 
meaning, among other things, to kill, to exterminate. This opinion was 
followed by Menage and by Falconet. De Volney also adopted this 
etymology without citing any evidence (Voyage en Egypte et en Syrie, 
3rd edn, Vol 1, p 404). 
Benjamin of Tudela mentions the Assassins in two passages (Itiner. 
D. Benjaminis, pp 32, 89): he writes their name the first time, when 
talking about the Assassins of Syria, with a heth; in the second passage, 
referring to the Isma'ilis of Persia, whom he calls Molahat, a 
corruption foralahida:he says that they acknowledged the 
authority of the old man residing in the land of the Cashishin, as 
Baratier rightly rendered it, and not, as Constantin Lempereur 
ludicrously translated, seniorem suae regionis Alcaschischin, quasi 
senes dicas appellantes. 1 am noting this so that no one should imagine, 
on false authority, that Benjamin of Tudela interpreted the word 
Assassins as meaning old man. For all I know, some manuscripts of this 
Jewish writer may also have Hashishin in the second passage written 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
with a heth instead of a caf; in any case, the substitution of caf for heth 
should not surprise anyone familiar with oriental languages. I would 
add that when quoting Benjamin of Tudela, I do not claim to guarantee 
the reality of his journey. However, although he probably never set eyes 
on many of the countries he described, it cannot be denied that his 
sources were quite reliable. 
The learned author of the Bibliotheca Orientalis Clementino Vati- 
cana (Vol2, pp 214, 215, 320), Joseph-Simon Assemani, having found 
a town, called Hasasa by the Arabs and Beth-hasosonoye or Hasoso- 
nitho by the Syrians, in the Takrit region in Mesopotamia, imagined 
that this was the place from which the Assassins mentioned by the 
historians of the Crusades had derived their name. This conjecture is 
not based on any historical foundation and was not worthy of being 
adopted by the author of the Oriens Christianus (Vol2, col 1584). The 
spelling of this name bears no similarity with that of the real Arabic 
name of the Assassins. Falconet has rejected this conjecture of 
Assemani's; but through another error, he confused H a sa s awith 
A'zaz, or Izaz, a town in Mesopotamia, although these two names 
have no consonants in common (Mhoires de I'Acadhie des lnscrip- 
tions, Vol XVII, p 163). 
Falconet mentioned another origin for the name of the Assassins, an 
origin he himself rejects, but I must not omit it because it might find 
supporters, and it actually had the approval of D. Carpentier, the 
author of the Glossarium ad scriptores medii aevi. Besides, this will 
provide me with an opportunity to make a few useful observations. 
Abu'l-Fida, in his Description of Syria (Tab. Syriae, p 19), mentions 
that Masyat, a town that was the headquarters of the Isma'ili sect ih 
Syria, is situated on a mountain called Jabal assikkin Uabal al-sikkin). 
As sikkin means knife, dagger, the name of this mountain may mean 
mountain of the Knife, and there seems to be some analogy between 
this designation, the atrocities of which the Assassins were accused, and 
their being called Assassins. 
'We have seen', says Falconet (Mhoires de I'Acadhie des Inscrip- 
tions, Vol XVII, p 163), 
that the Assikkin mountain, the mountain of the Dagger, was the 
residence of the commander of the Assassins in Syria; the knives 
used by the Assassins were called sikkin; their sovereign was 
attributed the title magister cultellorum by Jacques de Vitry; his 
subjects were called cultelliferi by Matthew Paris, and even sicarii 
by William of Newburgh . . . But all these concordances, however 
felicitous they may be, merely form one of those far too often 

misleading clues in the search for the origin of words, without 
prevailing against the etymology we first proposed. 
The etymology favoured by Falconet is, as I mentioned before, the 
one proposed by Hyde. 
Falconet's reflections are highly justified. But we can add, in order to 
give them more weight, first, that there is in fact no great resemblance 
between the word alsikkin or assikkin and the name Assassins; 
secondly, that it is doubtful whether Jabal assikkin means mountain of 
the Dagger (la montagne du Poignard). Abu'l-Fida does not mention it. 
It is true that Koehler's translation says: De hac denominatione montis, 
qua Assekkin vocatur, quod cultrum significat, mirifice commentus est 
lbn Said. But the words quod cultrum significat were added by the 
translator, and we do not know the special origin attributed to this 
term by Ibn Sacid, whose work has not come down to us (Michaelis 
Descriptio Aegypti, p 36; Reiske in d'Herbelot's Biblioth2que orientale, 
The Hague, 1779, Vol 4, p 754; Rommel, Abulf. Arab. Desc., p 7). 
Perhaps Sekkin in this case is the name of a man, so that we should 
translate Sekkin's mountain (la montagne de Sekkin). What is at least 
certain is that a person called Sekkin played an important part in this 
country around the time of Hakim and in the establishment of the 
religion of the Druzes, and that we have, in the collection of sacred 
books of this sect (Arabic Manuscript of the Bibliothkque du Roi, no 
158), a diploma dating from the tenth year of the Hamza era, 418 of 
the Hegira, in which Sekkin is appointed superintendent or inspector 
general of a diocese, or an ecclesiastical province, designated as the 
peninsula of the upper Syria and apparently having as its borders 
Arabia to the south, Hamat and its territory to the north, Iraq to the 
east, and the Mediterranean to the west. He was authorized to have 
under him twelve da'is or missionaries and some other ministers of a 
lower rank. The writings of the Druzes also inform us that Sekkin was 
not content with his rank and wanted to assume a higher one in the 
hierarchy; that he committed many robberies that rendered the name of 
the Druzes odious; and finally, that he introduced novelties, idolatry 
and other abominations into the religion.31 This Sekkin is probably the 
same of whom Abul-Fida reports the intrigues and the death in the 
year 434, in the following terms (Annales Moslemici, Vol 3, p 119): 
In this same year, in the month of Rajab, there rose up in Misr a 
man called Sekkin, who resembled Hakim. He pretended to be 
Hakim; he was followed by a group of men who counted on 
Hakim's return. These people marched towards the palace, at a 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
time when the caliph was alone and had withdrawn into his 
apartments, and shouted: Here is Hakim. Those who were 
guarding the gate at this moment were at first frightened; but 
then, suspecting some mistake, they arrested Sekkin, and he was 
crucified with his partisans. 
Incidentally, I am only mentioning this as a conjecture, which can 
even be questioned by the fact that Sekkin, as the proper name of a 
man, does not ordinarily have an article. It is nevertheless useful to 
observe that in one of the writings directed against Sekkin, it is said 
that he put his trust in the mountains where he resides; which adds 
considerable strength to my conjecture (Trad. manus. des livres 
religieux des Druzes, Vol 2, p 1000). 
Let us go on to another etymology, or rather to two different 
etymologies, proposed by a scholar whose authority has great weight in 
the field of Arabic literature. It is Reiske whom I have in mind (Annales 
Moslemici, Vol 3, p 714, annotation 251). This clever orientalist 
assumes that the word assassins is simply a corruption, and that 
the Isma'ilis or Batinis were called Hassanini or Hassanici after the 
head of their sect, Hasan bin Sabbah. 'Or perhaps,' he says, 'since this 
name is often written chassassin, which the Germans would render as 
schassasin, their name in Arabic was jassas: this word is pronounced in 
Arabic approximately like chassas in French or schassas in German, 
and means "spyn.' There is no need for me to dwell on the discussion of 
these two etymologies, the first of which is based on a very far-fetched 
assumption, while the second is devoid of all verisimilitude. Suffice it to 
say that if Reiske had, as I have, come across the name Assassins 
written in Arabic letters, he would have ventured neither of these 
conjectures. 
A very different and apparently better grounded etymology is that of 
abbot Simon Assemani, Professor of oriental languages at the seminary 
of Padua, recently proposed in the dissertation I already mentioned, 
which is included in the June 1808 [I8061 issue of the Literary Journal 
of Padua. It is entitled Ragguaglio storico-critic0 sopra la setta 
Assissana, detta volgarrnente degli ASSASSINZ. 
Mr Simon Assemani says: 
While I was in Syrian Tripoli, a city where the nearby mountains 
still contain remnants of this sect, I often heard this rhymed jibe 
against those who came to do their errands in town: Assissani 
(al-sisani) la muslim wa la nasrani, the Assissani is neither a 
Muslim nor a Christian, meaning that these people have no 

religion, precisely because as followers of the doctrine of Hasan, 
they have no external 
Note that the historians of the 
Crusades here transposed the two vowels i and a, so that instead 
of Assissani they said Assassini; and this is how the name entered 
our language, to designate the villains who lay in ambush to 
commit homicide. The rulers of this sea were indeed well-known 
for sending their professional killers everywhere to massacre 
anyone they disliked. 
Assissani [he adds] comes from assissa (al-sisa), meaning rock, 
fortress, a fortified place offering a safe retreat; hence Assissani 
(al-sisani), in Arabic, designates a man who lives among rocks and 
fortified places, as we would say a mountain-dweller, a man who 
lives in the mountains. 
Despite the esteem I have for the talents of abbot Assemani, I cannot 
concur with his opinion on the origin of the name Assassins. Here are 
my reasons: first, sisa, or rather sisiya, does not really mean a rock, but 
anything that serves as a defence, the horn of a bull, the spur of a cock, 
the antler of an antelope, and by the same token, a citadel, a fortified 
place. Secondly, sisani is not regularly formed from sisiya, it should 
have been sisi; on the other hand, sisani is regularly formed from sisan, 
plural of sus, chicken, from which is also formed the verb sawsa, to 
cheep like a little chicken; from the plural sisan, the word sisani, 
chicken-seller, is formed, just as dajajati, poultry-seller, is formed from 
dajajat, the plural of dajaja; kutubi, bookseller, from kutub, plural of 
kitab, book; lubudi, felt-seller, from lubud, plural of libd, felt; sanadiqi, 
chest-seller, from sanadiq, plural of sanduq, chest; hawayisi, belt-seller, 
from hawayis, plural of hiyasa, belt. The proverb reported by Assemani 
may thus apply to mountain dwellers or villagers who come to town to 
sell their poultry, and what it means is that these people are dishonest 
and uncouth and that due to their great ignorance, they belong to no 
religon. 
I must point out, moreover, that this proverb is also used in another 
sense, which might be closer to its origin. Instead of al-sisani, the word 
often used is al-sasani, as Michel Sabbagh of Acre informed me; which 
means of the family of Susan. This term is used by the Arabs to indicate 
a vagrant, an adventurer, a man who roams around to make money 
without doing anything. It is in this sense that Hariri, in his forty-ninth 
assembly, has Abu Zayd Saruji, a person of this type, say: 
I have not found easier gain, a more pleasant subsistence, a more 
lucrative profession, a brook with purer water, than the trade 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
created by Sasan, of which he devised various modifications . . . It 
is a business that never flags, a reservoir that never dries out, a 
torch in whose light a great number of men assemble, and which 
enlightens the blind and the one-eyed. Those who practise this 
profession are the happiest people, the most fortunate race . . . 
They have no fixed dwelling, they fear no authority. There is no 
difference between them and the birds who rise with an empty 
stomach and by the evening, have eaten their fill . . . But the first 
condition for practising this profession is to move around a great 
deal; the first quality required is constant activity. A resourceful 
mind must be the torch of him who adopts it; impudence, the 
armour that he must be equipped with . . . So do not tire in your 
search, do not lose heart in exercising every kind of diligence; for 
it was written on the staff of our chief Sasan: He who will search 
will find; he who comes and goes will obtain. 
It was in the same spirit that Hariri, in his second assembly, says of 
Abu Zayd: 'He made up all kinds of genealogies to show himself off, 
and he resorted to every possible way of making money. Sometimes he 
said that he belonged to the family of Sasan, and sometimes he claimed 
to be a descendant of the kings of Ghassan.' 
Mutarrizi, the commentator of Hariri, explains the word Sasan as 
follows: 
Sasan [he says,] is the chief of beggars and their patron. The Sasan 
in question is the ancient Sasan, son of Bahman, son of Isfandiyar, 
son of king Gushtasp. This is how his story is told by Ibn al-ua n n a . 'When Bahman was about to die, he summoned his 
daughter Humay, who was pregnant. She surpassed all mortals in 
beauty, and no one, among the Persians of that time, equalled her 
in wisdom. Then the king asked for his crown, put it on his 
daughter's head, and declared that she was to be queen after him, 
ordering that, if she gave birth to a male child, she should 
continue ruling the kingdom until her son reached the age of 30, 
at which time she should hand the government to him. Sasan, the 
son of Bahman, was a very handsome man, well-bred and full of 
wisdom and all kinds of accomplishments; no one doubted that he 
would inherit the throne. When Bahman had thus bequeathed his 
kingdom to Humay, the sister of Sasan, the latter was greatly 
vexed, so he went away, bought some sheep, led them to the 
mountains himself and occupied himself with taking them to 
pasture, living among the Kurds, all this as a result of the anger he 

had felt because of the contempt his father had shown him by 
depriving him of the crown and giving it to his sister. From that 
time until today, the name Sasan has been adopted as a 
metaphorical term for a man who drives a flock of sheep, being 
referred to as Sasan the Kurd or Sasan the shepherd. Hence the 
name Sasani is applied to designate any man who begs or who 
does a low job, such as blind or one-eyed men, jugglers, people 
who train and show dogs or monkeys, and others of this type, 
although they do not descend from Sasan. Such men are very 
numerous, and they include many different classes and types. Abu 
Dulaf Khazraji mentions them in a poem in which he describes, by 
having them speak in their own words, all their trades, their 
juggleries, their tales, and the special language they use among 
themselves. This poem, known by the name of Sasaniyya, was 
commented on by Sahib bin Abbad; the reader will find in it a 
detailed account of what I have briefly described. 
It is easily conceived, by reading the above, that the proverb he is a 
Sasani, neither a Muslim nor a Christian makes sense as such, but bears 
no relation to the Assassins. 
After Assemani, another orientalist published an article in the first 
issue of the journal entitled Les Mines de I'Orient,j4 in which he rejects 
Hyde's etymology, which he attributes to de Volney, and proposes to 
derive the word Assassins from 'asas, night watch. 
I also heard from Dominique Sestini that an Armenian scholar, asked 
about the etymology of this word, derived it from habash habash, a 
pack of people of all sorts. 
The first of these two etymologies might have been acceptable, if we 
were reduced to conjectures on the subject; the second one cannot even 
be proposed. 
Since I have already mentioned Mariti's Historical Memoirs on the 
Assassins and the Old Man of the Mountain, I must add here that this 
writer favours one of the least plausible etymologies proposed for the 
name Assassins. He thinks that their true name was Arsasides or 
Arsacides, and that they were thus called because the first founders of 
this tribe who, after arriving in Syria, were known there by the name of 
Assassins, had been Kurds who originally lived in the surroundings 
under the jurisdiction of the city of Arsacia. It is not even worth our 
while to disprove this theory. 
It may surprise the reader that I have not yet mentioned another 
etymology reported by MCnage, whose author istienne Lemoine, a 
Protestant minister at Rouen. It is included in a letter written by 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
Lemoine to Menage, which the latter published in his Dictionnaire 
btymologique de la langue Franoise (Etymological Dictionary of the 
French Language), under the word Assassins. I shall merely quote the 
part which concerns my subject. 
The word Assassin [says Lemoine,] was applied to the Old Man of 
the Mountain, king of the Assassins, who is thus called in the 
sense of king of pastures, of meadows, of gardens. Indeed, this 
king occupied, at the foot of the Lebanon, a very good land which 
may well have derived its name from its fertility. Assessa, or 
Assissa, means herb, pastures, gardens, things that existed in 
abundance in the countries ruled by this prince. You know how 
he deceived many of his subjects by means of these delightful 
gardens, and how he engaged them to take every risk by 
promising them that they would enjoy all these beautiful places 
after their death . . . Benjamin calls him sheikh el-chasisin, and 
that is how he is called all over the Orient. This is why we came to 
call him the king of the Assassins. But these words, as I already 
said, mean king of the prairies, of cultivated lands, of gardens in 
which art and nature vie with one another to provide an infinite 
number of delightful things. 
This etymology was disapproved of, according to Menage's report, 
by Ferrari, the learned professor of Padua, who preferred to derive the 
word assassin, ab assidendo; and Menage himself did not hesitate to 
embrace the opinion of de Caseneuve, who derived this word from the 
old Teutonic sahs, knife. Falconet also says, without much ado, that the 
etymology is as false as the conclusions drawn from it by Lemoine 
(Mimoires de I'Acadhie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, Vol XVII, 
p 155). Nevertheless this is the only correct etymology, as I hope to 
prove; but Lemoine did not know why the Isma'ilis bore the name 
Hashishin, and he gave a very bad reason for it which caused his 
etymology to be rejected. I hope to offer a much more satisfactory 
reason for this designation. I therefore have to show two things: first, 
that the Isma'ilis or Batinis also bore the name Hashishin; secondly, 
what the reason for this designation was. 
The first proposition is easy to establish. We need only observe that 
in the word Hashishin, the ending in is the plural sign. In classical 
Arabic the ending of the masculine plural is una for the nominative and 
ina for the two other cases; in everyday language, the final vowel a is 
eliminated and the ending is pronounced in without any case 
distinctions. Example: Muslimin, the Muslims; Mu'minin, the faithful; 

Kafirin, the infidels. Hashishin, or more grammatically Hashishiyyin, is 
hence the plural of Hashishi: the same word can also form the plural 
Hashishiyya, which is even more elegant. We must not lose sight of this 
trivial observation, which I had to make for people who have no idea of 
the Arabic language. 
Abu'l-Fida in his Annals and Baha al-Din in his Life of Saladin 
report that in the year 571, while this prince was laying siege to the 
citadel of Izaz, some Isma'ilis tried to assassinate him. It was the 
second time that his life had been threatened by people of this sect; an 
unsuccessful attempt had already been made in 570. As Abul-Fida's 
account is more detailed, I shall quote from him (Annaks Moslemici, 
Vol 4, pp 21, 25). 
In the year 570, Sacd al-Din Gumushtigin sent a large sum of 
money to Sinan, the chief of the Isma'ilis, so that they should kill 
Saladin. Sinan sent several men who suddenly attacked Saladin; 
but they were killed without being able to take his life. 
In the year 571 . . . sultan Saladin advanced towards Izaz; he 
laid siege to the place on the 3rd of Dhu'l-Qa'da and took it on 
the 11th of Dhu'l-Hijja. While he was besieging this town, an 
Ismacili fell upon him, stabbed him in the head with a dagger and 
wounded him. Saladin caught hold of the Isma'ili, who continued 
attacking him, without managing to stab him. He was killed in 
this situation. A second one attacked the sultan and was also 
killed. Then a third one met with the same fate. Frightened, the 
sultan went into his tent, had his troops inspected and sent away 
the people he did not know. 
We shall now see in what terms these two events are reported by Abu 
Shama, the author of the Kitab al-awdatan?a very detailed history 
of Nur al-Din and Saladin (Arabic Manuscript of the Bibliothtque du 
Roi, no 707 A, under the year 570, fol 127v): 
In the year 570, Saladin advanced towards Hamat and took it on 
the first day of Jumada 11. From there he marched towards Aleppo 
and laid siege to this city on the 3rd of the same month. As the 
inhabitants found themselves in a desperate situation and in great 
need of help, they appealed to the Isma'ilis, promised them 
certain lands and made them all kinds of generous gifts. One day 
when it was very cold and the winter was severely making itself 
felt, a few of the most determined of these villains came. They 
were recognized by the emir Nasih al-Din Khumartekin, the 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
master of Buqtish, whose properties bordered on those of the 
Isma'ilis. What are you doing, said the emir, and how could you 
dare come here without being deterred by fear? So they killed 
him; a man who came running to defend him was also wounded 
by them. One of them suddenly came forth to hurl himself on the 
sultan, but the emir Tughril Khazandar was resolutely waiting for 
him without moving and without saying a word; and the moment 
he arrived, he cut off his head with his sabre. The others were only 
killed after they themselves had killed a large number of men, and 
those who were confronting them ran great risks. So on this 
occasion, God saved the life (literally, the last breath) of the sultan 
from the daggers of al-Hashishiyya. 
The author here makes a play on words with hushasha, the last 
breath, and hashishiyya, plural of hashishi; and it is perhaps for the 
sake of this play on words that he uses this designation instead of the 
word Isma'ilis. 
We shall go on to the second event. This is how it is reported (Arabic 
Manuscript of the Bibliothkque du Roi, no 707 A, under the year 571, 
fol 137r): 
Chapter containing the narrative of the second attempt of the 
Hashishis on the life of the sultan: this one took place while he 
was besieging Izaz; the first one had happened in front of Aleppo. 
On the 11th of Dhu'l-Qa'da, says Imad al-Din, during the 
night of the first day of the week, the Hashishis attacked the 
sultan while he was camping in front of Izaz. The emir Jawali 
Asadi had his tent near the machines, and the sultan was going to 
this tent to inspect the machines, to give orders regarding the most 
important affairs, and to arouse the ardour of the warriors. While 
he was busy distributing gifts and making up for the evils caused 
by fortune's cruelty, some Hashishis were standing there disguised 
as soldiers, and the troops forming several lines were near the 
sultan. Suddenly one of the Hashishis fell upon the sultan and 
stabbed him in the head with his dagger. The metal plates inside 
his helmet prevented the dagger from injuring his head, and the 
weapon only slightly wounded his cheek. Without losing heart, 
the sultan seized the head of the Hashishi and pulled it towards 
him, then threw himself on the man and straddled him; thereupon 
Sayf al-Din Yazkuj appeared, took the Hashishi's life, and cut him 
in pieces. Another one advanced; but the emir Da'ud,, son of 
Minkilan, rushed at him and stopped him. The Hashishi dealt him 

a wound in his side, from which he died a few days later. A third 
one appeared; the emir Ali, son of Abu'l-Fawaris, caught him in 
his arms and held him tightly embraced under his armpits. The 
Hashishi's hand was caught behind his back, so that he could not 
strike or disengage himself from his awkward position.36 The emir 
shouted: 'Kill me with him; for he has dealt me a mortal blow, he 
has deprived me of my strength and made me incapable of 
fighting.' Then Nasir al-Din, son of Shirkuh, pierced this man 
with his sword. Another one came out of the tent and fled, ready 
to strike anyone who might stand in his way; but the servants of 
the army fell on him and killed him. 
I leave out the rest of this account. The author adds an excerpt from 
a letter by the qadi Fadil containing an account of the same event, 
where he says that the Hashishi had merely given the sultan a scratch, 
from which he had lost only a few drops of blood. 
Finally, as is the custom with Orientals, the author reports another 
account of the same event, by an author called Ibn Abi Tayy. I shall 
translate that as well, despite the repetitions it involves, because the 
expressions used in this account are worth considering (Arabic 
Manuscript of the Bibliothique du Roi, no 707 A, under the year 571, 
fol 137 v): 
Here is how Ibn Abi Tayy expresses himself, says the author of the 
Rawdatayn: When the sultan had captured Bazagha and Manbij, 
those who were the masters of Aleppo fully realized that they 
would inevitably find themselves deprived of one after the other of 
the fortified places and citadels they possessed. So they went back 
to their usual intrigues and started setting traps for the sultan 
again. They consequently wrote a second letter to Sinan, the 
master of the hashisha [I shall explain this expression below], won 
him over with money and persuaded him to send his men to kill 
the sultan. Sinan (may God curse him!) actually dispatched some 
of his men, who joined Saladin's army, disguised as soldiers. They 
mingled with the warriors, participated in military operations, 
and did so with great bravery. They took care to mix with the 
sultan's people, in the hope of finding an opportunity to carry out 
their project, and to seize the appropriate occasion. 
So one day when the sultan was sitting in the tent of the emir 
Jawali, while the fight was going on and the sultan was watching 
it, one of the Hashishis pounced on him and dealt him a blow on 
the head with his dagger. As the sultan always suspected some 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
surprise on behalf of the Hashishis, he never took off his armour 
and always had his head protected by metal plates. The blow dealt 
by the Hashishi did not cut through the metal plates covering the 
sultan's head; and having felt these metal plates, the Hashishi let 
his hand with the dagger slide down toward the sultan's cheek, 
wounding him so that the blood ran down his face. This made the 
sultan reel. The Hashishi took advantage of this moment, leapt on 
the sultan, and pulled his head toward himself so that he dragged 
him to the ground; and sitting astride him, he tried to slit his 
throat.37 Those who were surrounding the sultan were in a state 
of stupor that seemed to deprive them of their reason. At this 
moment Sayf al-Din Yazkuj appeared. Some say that he had been 
present before. He drew his sabre, struck the Hashishi with it and 
killed him. 
Another Hashishi ran up to throw himself on the sultan; but the 
emir Minkilan the Kurd stood in his way and struck him with his 
sword. The Hashishi had, however, forestalled Minkilan and 
wounded him in the forehead. Minkilan killed him, but he himself 
died a few days later from the blow the Hashishi had dealt him. 
Yet another of the Batinis appeared, and stood near the emir Ali, 
son of Abu'l-Fawaris. The emir swooped down on the Batini, but 
the Batini advanced under his impact to strike him. Ali seized him 
under the armpits, and the Batini's hand remained behind him, so 
that he could not strike him. The emir Ali then shouted: Kill him 
and kill me with him; and Nasir al-Din, son of Shirkuh, came 
forward and plunged his sword into the Batini's belly and moved 
it around in all directions until the man fell down dead. This was 
how Ali, the son of Abu'l-Fawaris, was saved. Then another one 
of the Hashishis came out to escape; he was intercepted by the 
emir Shihab al-Din Mahmud, the sultan's maternal uncle. The 
Batini turned around to avoid the emir, but the emir's men ran 
towards him and cut him to pieces with their sabres. As for the 
sultan, he immediately mounted his horse and returned to his tent. 
Blood was running down his cheek. 
A little further on, the author of the Rawdatayn adds: 
In the year 572, peace having been made, the sultan remembered 
the revenge he had to take on the Isma'ilis, and the way they had 
come to attack him during this war. So he set out on Friday the 
19th of Ramadan, laid siege to their fortress of Masyat, and put 
up great war machines against them. He killed many of their 

people, took a great number of prisoners, took the men with him, 
ravaged the homes, destroyed the buildings, had their houses 
pillaged, until his maternal uncle Shihab al-Din Mahmud bin 
Tekish, prince of Hamat, interceded in their favour. For they had 
sent him messages to ask him to do so, seeing that they were his 
neighbours. The sultan then withdrew from their country, having 
had his revenge. 
After what we have just read, there is hardly any need to prove that 
the Hashishis, the Batinis and the Isma'ilis are the same people, or if 
you like, the same sea. We have seen that Ibn Abi Tayy uses the first 
two names indiscriminately, and that the author of the Rawdatayn says 
Isma'ilis when referring to the people he had previously called 
Hashishis (al-Hashishiyya). 
There would be no use looking for other authorities to prove this 
identity. I shall only point out that Ibn al-Khatib, the Arab historian of 
Spain, when referring to the violent death of the caliph Amir bi-Ahkam 
Allah, said that he was killed by Hashishis, while other historians, 
Abu'l-Fida, Mirkhwand, Maqrizi, say that this prince was assassinated 
by Isma'ilis, Batinis, or Nazaris [Nizaris]. I shall explain this last word 
below. 
Nor should there be any doubt, in my opinion, that the word 
hashishi, plural hashishin, is the origin of the corruptions heisessini, 
assassini, and assksini. It should not surprise us that the Arabic shin 
was transcribed by all our writers who used the Latin language by an s, 
and in the Greek historians by a sigma. They had no choice. It should, 
moreover, be observed that the shin is pronounced less strongly than 
the ch in French. What can rightly be asked is the reason why the 
Isma'ilis or Batinis were called Hashishis. This is the second thing I 
shall have to examine, and to which I shall merely reply by a 
conjecture, but by a conjecture that is, to my mind, of a highly plausible 
nature. 
Lemoine perhaps knew of some passages by Arab authors in which 
the Isma'ilis were referred to by the name Hashishis, and he had seen 
that this name was inevitably derived from hashish. Hashish means 
herb, forage. However, since this meaning bore no relation to what 
history teaches us about the Assassins, he assumed that hashish, which 
signifies herb, forage, could also be understood as meadows, prairies, 
delightful gardens. This false conclusion may have contributed to 
discrediting his proposed etymology in the minds of scholars, all the 
more so since he cited no Arab writer as evidence to prove that the 
Isma'ilis actually bore the name Hashishis in the Arabic language. 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
Perhaps he really knew of no other source than this passage by 
Benjamin of Tudela, although he does add, after mentioning the 
testimony of this rabbi, who called the Old Man of the Mountain 
Sheikh alchassisin, that this is how the latter was called all over the 
Orient. 
Lemoine did not know that among the simple or compound 
substances used by the Orientals to achieve a more or less advanced 
state of intoxication, there is one that is known by the name of hashish 
or hashisha. In my Chrestomathie Arabe, I published a very curious 
chapter of Maqrizi's Historical Description of Egypt and Cairo, a 
chapter dealing with this kind of electuary commonly known as 
hashisha, herb, but whose full name is hashishat al-fuqara, the herb of 
fakirs. According to Maqrizi, this is the name of the hemp leaf, and in 
fact, the same is also mentioned by Prosper Alpin, whom I find it 
necessary to quote verbatim (De Medic. Aegypt., pp 258, 261): 
I am not ignorant of the fact that the Egyptians, in order to 
provide themselves with these kinds of visions, use several 
compound drugs such as the electuary called bernavi, which is 
brought from the nearest regions of India, the bers and the bosa; 
but the one that is most commonly used among them is simply the 
hemp plant, which they call asis.* 
This word means nothing 
other than herb, so that it appears that they call hemp the herb 
par excellence. This proverbial way of expressing themselves, by 
saying to take herb instead of to take an intoxicating drug comes 
from the fact that hemp, as I have heard it said, is the first 
substance in which the property of arousing these fantastic visions 
has been recognized, or else it possesses this quality in a higher 
degree than all other drugs. 
The assis is simply a powder prepared from hemp leaves mixed 
with lukewarm water and made into a paste. Five or more boluses 
of it, the size of a chestnut, are swallowed. After an hour, they 
have their effect, and those who have taken them fall into a kind 
of drunkenness and indulge in all sorts of follies. They remain for 
a long time in a state of ecstasy, enjoying those visions they had 
longed for. The common people are particularly fond of using this 
drug, because it costs less than the others. It will hardly surprise 
you that hemp produces this effect; for as you know, Galien, in 
his first book of De alim. facult., states that it makes the vapours 
rise to the brain, and violently affects this organ. It is through this 
singular property that this plant has, as I said, earned itself the 
name assis, or as it were, the herb par excellence in this country. 

Kaempfer described three of the substances the Persians prefer to use 
to attain this kind of drunkenness which they call kayf. These 
substances, coming from the vegetable kingdom, are tobacco, opium 
and hemp. He describes the latter as follows (Amoenitatum exoti- 
carum, Lemgo, 1712, p 645): 
I shall now discuss hemp. Those who like to use a variety of 
intoxicating drugs, or who dislike the taste of opium, take hemp 
to achieve this kind of ecstatic intoxication. I shall not examine 
here whether this plant is really our hemp, or a particular variety 
called bang, described by the authors of the Hortus Malabaricus 
(Vol 10, p 119). As far as I am concerned, it seemed to resemble 
our common hemp like two peas in a pod, both the male and the 
female. I, therefore, tend to believe that this hemp owes its 
particular quality to the soil and the climate. The parts of the 
plant that produce this artificial gaiety are the seed, called 
shadanech; the pollen, called jars, and the leaves, which are 
known by the name of bang . . . The leaves are used by infusing 
them in cold water. Drinking this water produces a gaiety 
accompanied by a highly intoxicated state. I shall describe the 
methods used for its preparation, as I have seen it done by four 
dewishe: I met at a hostelry on the Indian border . . . Some people 
knead the leaf powder with syrup and make it into pastilles or 
boluses which they swallow with that intention. It is after the 
hemp leaves, the most valued of all intoxicating drugs, that men 
who have acquired the habit of intoxicating preparations are 
called banghi in Persia and India. 
Chardin informs us that in Persia, people who like to get intoxicated 
on tobacco, mix hemp seeds with it, which has the effect of making the 
vapour rise to the brain and quickly produce dizziness (voyage de 
Chardin, Paris, 181 1, Vol 3, p 302). 
Hemp is also used as an intoxicating substance in Barbary and 
Morocco, as Hoest and Lamprikre attest, and there, too, it is called 
hashish. Leo Africanus mentioned it by the name l'hasis, which is the 
same word with an article. In Aleppo, it serves the same purpose and 
has the same name, as Dr Russell confirms. It is smoked with the same 
intention in several countries, and even in Africa. 
Just like those in the cities [says Niebuhr (Description de l'Arabie, 
p 50),] the common Arabs also want to have their kayf, that is, 
their enjoyment, but as they cannot afford strong liquors, and 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
often are not even able to find any, they smoke hashish: it is a 
kind of herb that Forskal and some others who preceded us in the 
Orient took for hemp leaves. Those who are fond of it assert that 
it inspires courage. We saw an example of that in the person of 
one of our Arab servants. After smoking hashish, he met four 
soldiers in the street and took it into his head to chase them away. 
One of them gave him a good hiding and brought him home. 
Despite this little adversity, he would not calm down and was still 
quite convinced that four soldiers were unable to resist him. 
On the hemp grown in Egypt, Forskal says (Flor. Aeg. Ar., p lv): 
Cannabis. Arab. sjadanek. Colitur passim; floret fine april.; folia ad 
usus medicos; semina inebriantia. Usus textorum ignorantur.39 
Olivier also says (Voyage duns l'empire Othoman, Vol 2, p 169), 
talking of Egypt: 
The people have replaced the use of opium with that of hemp 
leaves, because they are much cheaper. Ground to a powder and 
mixed with honey, and sometimes with aromatic substances, they 
are made into boluses which are taken in order to obtain pleasant 
sensations, but their most certain effect is delirium, stupor, 
consumption and death, for those who continue using them. This 
plant, moreover, does not thrive well in Egypt. 
The same traveller, after referring to the use made of opium in coffee- 
houses in Persia, adds (Voyage dans l'emp. Oth., Vol 3, p 156): 
In these same coffee-houses, a much stronger, much more 
intoxicating beverage was often served: it was made of leaves and 
heads of ordinary hemp, to which a little nux vomica was added. 
The law, which allows or tolerates other beverages, has always 
prohibited this one. When we were in Persia, Mehemet Khan 
punished those who distributed it and those who took it, with the 
death sentence. 
Sonnini seems to make a distinction between the European hemp and 
the plant grown in Egypt, of which hashisha is made. Although the 
passage in which he discusses it is a little long, I shall copy the whole of 
it (Voyage dans la haute et basse Egypte, Vol 3, p 103). 
Hemp is grown in the plains of the same regions (of upper Egypt); 

but they do not make thread out of it, as in Europe, although it 
could probably serve that purpose. It is nevertheless a plant which 
is widely used. In the absence of intoxicating liquors, the Arabs 
and Egyptians make various preparations out of it, which provide 
them with a kind of mild drunkenness, a dreamy state which gives 
them gaiety and pleasant illusions. This kind of annihilation of the 
faculty of thought, this sleep of the soul, is unlike the drunkenness 
caused by wine and strong liquors, and our language has no terms 
to express it. The Arabs use the word kayf to describe this 
voluptuous abandon, this kind of delicious stupor. 
The most frequent way of preparing the hemp consists of 
crushing the fruits with their membraneous capsules (or rather 
husks); the resulting paste is then boiled with honey, pepper and 
nutmeg, and this concoction, which is as big as a nut, is 
swallowed. Poor people, who charm away their misery through 
the dizziness caused by hemp, content themselves with grinding 
the seed capsules mixed with water, and eating the paste. The 
Egyptians also eat these capsules without any preparation, and 
they even mix them with the tobacco they smoke. Sometimes they 
grind only the capsules and pistils into a h e  powder, throwing 
away the seeds. They mix this powder with an equal amount of 
tobacco and smoke the mixture in a kind of pipe, a very simple 
and coarse imitation of the Persian pipe: just a hollow coconut 
filled with water, through which they inhale the acrid and 
inebriating smoke. This way of smoking is one of the most 
common pastimes of the women of southern Egypt. 
All these preparations, as well as the parts of the plant that are 
used to make them, are known by the Arabic name hashish, which 
really means herb, as though this plant were the herb par 
excellence. Hashish, of which considerable amounts are con- 
sumed, can be found in all markets. When people want to refer to 
the plant itself, leaving aside its properties and its use, they call it 
bast. 
Although Egyptian hemp is very similar to ours, it nevertheless 
differs from it through a few characteristics that seem to make it a 
particular species.40 When carefully comparing this hemp with the 
European hemp, we notice that its stalk is much shorter, and that 
it makes up in thickness what it lacks in height; that the shape of 
the plant is more like that of a shrub, with its trunk often 
measuring more than two inches in circumference, and its 
numerous alternate branches starting from the bottom. Its leaves 
are also broader and more serrate. The entire plant has a stronger 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
smell, and the fruits are smaller and at the same time more 
numerous than those of the European species. 
After all that has been said, it is no doubt easy to believe that the 
Isma'ilis were called Hashishis because of their using hashish, in the 
same way as those who use bang (whether bang is also an electuary 
made of hemp leaves, as Kaempfer says, or rather an extraa of the 
narcotic plant called datura, as other authors maintain), opium, called 
a&n, and other drugs known by the general term tariak, are called 
bangi, afyuni, tariaki. 
And what I am saying about the use of hashish among the Isma'ilis is 
confirmed by this passage of Maqrizi (Silvestre de Sacy, Chrestomathie 
Arabe, Paris, 1806, Vol 1, p 130; Vol 2, p 133): 
Around this time (the year 795) there came to Cairo a man of the 
sea of the Mulhids or Isma'ilis of Persia, who prepared the 
hashisha by mixing it with honey, and adding various dry 
substances to it, like mandrake root and other drugs of the same 
kind. He called this mixture uqda (that is, jelly, confection), and 
secretly sold it. 
It is worth noting that the two adjectives or epithets hashishi and 
hashshash are also formed from the word hashish or hashisha. We have 
seen how the former [hashishr) was used in various passages I quoted, 
and that is certainly what Maqrizi had in mind when he said 
(Chrestomathie Arabe, Vol. 1, p 129; Vol 2, p 132): 'I know of a time 
when only people of the lowest class dared eat it; and even they were 
loath to hear themselves called by a name derived from this drug.'41 
The latter, hashshash, is found in the following passage by Shams al- 
Din Muhammad, son of Abu'l-Surur (Notices et Extraits des Manu- 
scrits, Vol 1, p 274): 'The new bridge over the big canal is now known 
by the name bridge of the hashshash (qantarat al-hashshashin), because 
it is the place where the mastuls (the drunkards, as it were) among the 
inhabitants of Cairo took their hashish.' 
The words hashishin and hashshashin produced the two denomina- 
tions assissini and assassini mentioned by Joinville. 
1 will not deny, however, that two objections may be raised against 
what I just said: the first is that the drunkenness caused by hashish 
merely consists of a kind of quiet ecstasy, rather than a vehemence apt 
to fire the courage and the imagination to undertake and carry out 
daring and dangerous acts; the second is that, according to Maqrizi, the 
introduction of hashish into Syria and Egypt, and even the discovery of 

the intoxicating effect of hemp, came later than the period of the 
Assassins. 
To reply to the first objection is not difficult. Reports about the 
obedience of the Assassins to their chief and the determination with 
which they risked their lives to kill the designated victims; the journeys 
they ventured upon to reach their destination; the cold-blooded way in 
which they watched for the right moment to carry out their plan, and 
knew how to take the appropriate action; all this does not point to 
furious men, like the Indian Arnoks, capable of doing anything through 
a kind of artificially induced delirim:but rather to fanatics 
convinced that by laying down their life to obey the commands of 
heaven manifested by those of their chiefs, they would secure 
themselves eternal happiness and all the enjoyments of the senses. And 
this is actually how the historians represent them. What, then, was the 
effect of hashisha on these men? It was to procure them, when it 
pleased their master to administer them a dose of this electuary, of 
which he alone possessed the secret, a state of ecstasy and sweet, 
profound illusions, during which they enjoyed or imagined they 
enjoyed all the sensual delights that embellish the paradise of 
Muhammad. Let us hear what Marco Polo, or rather the redactor of 
the Italian text of his account, tells us; this account is the best 
commentary on what 1 just said: 
I shall now discuss the Old Man of the Mountain. Mulehet is a 
region formerly inhabited by the man called the Old Man of the 
Mountain. For the name Mulehet means, in the language of the 
Saracens, the place where the heretics live; and from the name of 
this place, those who live there are called Mulehetics, that is, 
heretics of their religion:3 
as are the patarins4" among the 
Christians. This is what Marco Polo relates about the Old Man of 
the Mountain, having heard it told by several people. This prince 
was calledl a o d i n'  
and was Mahometan. He had created, in a 
lovely valley enclosed between two very high mountains, a very 
beautiful garden full of every variety of fruit and trees that could 
be obtained, and around these plantations, various palaces and 
pavilions decorated with golden ornaments, paintings and furni- 
ture all made of silk. There, in little canals corresponding to 
different parts of these palaces, one could see running streams of 
wine, of milk, of honey, and of the most limpid water. He had 
brought young girls of perfect beauty and full of charm to live 
here, and they were trained to sing, to play all sorts of 
instruments, to dance, and above all, to make the most seductive 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
advances to men that can be imagined. These young girls could be 
seen all the time, covered in gold and silk, walking along in these 
gardens and palaces. As for the women who served the prince, 
these were always kept indoors and were never seen outside. This 
is the reason why the Old Man had this palace built: Mahomet 
having said that those who obeyed his will would go to paradise, 
where they would find all the pleasures and delights of the world, 
beautiful women and rivers of milk and honey, this man wanted 
to pretend that he was a prophet and a companion of Mahomet, 
and that he could make anyone he wished enter this very paradise. 
No one could penetrate into the garden we described, for they had 
built, at the entrance to the valley, a very fortified and impregn- 
able castle; it could only be entered by a secret road. 
This Old Man had at his court young men aged from 12 to 20, 
chosen among those mountain dwellers who appeared to him to 
be capable of handling arms, daring and brave. He constantly 
talked to them every day about this paradise of Mahomet's, and 
of his own power to make them enter it. Whenever it pleased him, 
he ordered that 10 or 12 of these young men be given a certain 
drink that put them to sleep; and when they looked as though 
they were half dead, he had them transported to various rooms of 
these palaces. When they woke up in these places, they saw all the 
things we described; each one of them was surrounded by these 
young girls who sang, played instruments, and practised all the 
caresses and games they could imagine, and presented them with 
the most exquisite dishes and wines. In this way the young men, 
intoxicated with so many pleasures and the streams of milk and 
wine they saw, had no doubt whatever that they were in paradise, 
and never wanted to leave it.46 
Four or five days later, the Old Man had them put to sleep 
again and carried out of the garden. He would then summon them 
and ask them where they had been. By your grace, Sire, they 
would say, we were in paradise. Then they would describe what 
they had seen in everybody's presence. Their story would arouse 
the admiration of all those who heard it, as well as the desire for a 
similar happiness. The Old Man would answer: this is the 
commandment of our prophet; he makes anyone who fights to 
defend his lord enter paradise. If you obey me, you will enjoy the 
same bliss. Through such speeches, he influenced their minds to 
such an extent that the person whom he ordered to die in his 
service would consider himself happy. All the sovereigns or other 
persons who were enemies of the Old Man of the Mountain were 

killed by these assassins who were at his service. For none of them 
feared death, as long as they carried out the orders and wishes of 
their Sire, and they willingly exposed themselves to all the most 
obvious dangers, completely disregarding the loss of their present 
life. That is why the Old Man was feared in all these countries as 
a tyrant. He had established two lieutenants, one in the surround- 
ings of Damascus, the other in Kurdistan; and these behaved in 
the same manner with regard to the young men he sent them. So 
no matter how powerful a man was, if he was an enemy of the 
Old Man, he was bound to be killed. 
All the authors who have written about the Assassins, such as 
Amalric, Hayton, William of Tyre, Jacques de Vitry, Jean de Joinville 
and Arnold of Lubeck, knew of no other principle governing their 
conduct than blind obedience to their chief, based on the hope of 
boundless happiness in the future (Gesta Dei per Francos, Vol 1, 
p 1062). It is quite remarkable that Marco Polo mentions an 
intoxicating beverage, which their chief had them drink when he 
wanted to have them transported to his enchanted gardens.47 As we 
have seen, all the intoxicating preparations made with hemp, such as 
boluses, mixtures, liquors, fumigations, are equally called hashisha. In 
fact, I do not know whether we should literally believe in the existence 
of these enchanted gardens, or whether they were nothing but a vision 
produced by the excited imagination of the young men who were 
intoxicated by the hashisha, and who had long been deluded by the 
image of such bliss. What we know. for certain is that even today, 
people who take opium or hashish can, even if covered in poverty's rags 
and staying in a miserable tavern, derive happiness and pleasures that 
are short of nothing but reality. 
I have already mentioned that the constructions, the plantations, and 
the running waters with which Hasan had adorned the fortress and 
surroundings of Alatnut, his residence, may have contributed to 
spreading the legend of his enchanted gardens. Arnold of Lubeck also 
mentions beautiful palaces situated in the mountains, where young men 
destined to practise the profession of assassins were 
Let us hear what Prosper Alpin has to say about the effects the 
Egyptians attribute to the use of opium, hashish and other substances 
they take to attain this desired state of delirium and reverie (De Medic. 
Aegypt., p 257): 
Some of them maintain that, when they have taken a dose of 
opium, assis, bousa or bemavi, or else a pinch of bers, they see, as 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
in a dream, a great number of magnificent orchards and beautiful 
girls, full of attractions and charms; others say that, when in this 
state, they only see the objects they like best: those who enjoy the 
sight of orchards see orchards; lovers see their mistresses; warriors 
see battles. 
Russell, in his Natural History of Aleppo, says that he had witnessed 
the folly of one of these opium-eaters who, thinking he was a pasha, 
had without further ado occupied the place of honour on the sofa and 
was talking familiarly with the master of the house, entering into details 
about the affairs of his would-be government, condemning one person 
to be beaten, another to jail, dismissing some of his officers, appointing 
others, and thus enjoying his newly acquired fortune, which had cost 
him no more than a strong dose of opium, until a sudden noise made 
behind him on purpose drew him out of his dreams and put an end to 
his happiness. 
It is true that the immoderate and habitual use of hashish destroys all 
the faculties and would have been inappropriate in serving the aims of 
the Isma'ilis. Here is what the physician Ibn Baytar says about it 
(Chrestomatbie Arabe, Vol 1, p 127; Vol 2, p 131): 
There is a third variety of hemp which is called Indian hemp. 1 
have seen it nowhere else except in Egypt. They grow it in gardens 
and call it hashisha. It is highly intoxicating, if one or two 
drachmas of it are taken. If used in immoderate quantities, it 
produces a kind of insanity. People who have used it regularly 
have felt this pernicious effect. It weakens their minds and finally 
leads to lunacy; sometimes it even leads to death. I have seen 
fakirs use it in various ways: some of them boil the leaves of this 
plant, then knead it with their hands to form a kind of paste of 
which they make pastilles; others leave them to dry, then roast 
them, crush them with their hands, mix them with a few sesame 
seeds without the tegument, add some sugar, and then eat this dry 
drug, chewing on it for a long time. At the same time, they 
gesticulate and are in high spirits; and as it intoxicates them, they 
reach a state of madness or something very close to it. 
Ala al-Din bin Nafis, another physician quoted by Maqrizi, also says 
that the use of this drug produces base inclinations and degrades the 
soul, and that, in those who have acquired the habit, all the natural 
faculties deteriorate, so that at the end they no longer have any of the 

attributes of humanity (Chrestomathie Arabe, Vol 1, p 127; Vol 2, 
p 131). 
Maqrizi himself confirms all this through his own observations, and 
attributes the moral depravity and the apathy of his contemporaries to 
the immoderate use of hashisha (Chrestomathie Arabe, Vol 1, p 131; 
Vol 2, p 134). 
We have seen that, according to Olivier, its most certain effect is 
delirium, stupor, consumption and death, if a person continues to use 
it. 
Finally, in a decree issued by the French general in Egypt, on the 17th 
vendkmiaire of the year IX, we read: 
The use of the strong liquor made by some Muslims with a certain 
potent herb called hashish, as well as the smoking of hemp seed, 
are prohibited throughout Egypt. Those who are accustomed to 
drinking liquor and smoking this seed, lose their senses and fall 
into a violent delirium which often causes them to commit all 
sorts of excesses. 
This inconvenience attached to the excessive and daily use of hashish, 
which cannot be called into question, certainly did not apply to the 
Isma'ilis. It would have been diametrically opposed to the aim they 
were pursuing, and it may be supposed that an electuary, or, as Marco 
Polo mentioned, a beverage that was only administered by order of the 
chief, and of which only he had the secret, was used sparingly and 
within certain limits. 
I say of which only the chief had the secret; for this is how I 
understand the words of a historian I quoted above, who maintains 
that when those who governed Aleppo wanted to rid themselves of 
Saladin, they wrote to Sinan, the master or possessor of the hashisha, 
sahib al-hahisha.What I just said also serves as an answer to the second objection I 
raised against my own assertion, an objection resulting from Maqrizi's 
account, according to which the use of hashish was not introduced 
among the Muslims until about the beginning of the seventh century of 
the Hegira, that is long after the period of the great Ismaeili power, and 
shortly before their destruction by Hulagu. 
Maqrizi, in fact, following a great number of authorities, attributes 
the discovery of the intoxicating properties of the hemp leaf to Sheikh 
Haydar, who died in 618 of the Hegira. He adds that this secret 
remained for some time exclusively with the fakirs, the disciples of 
Sheikh Haydar; that the use of hemp was introduced into Iraq for the 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
first time in 628, by two sovereign princes, one of Hurmuz, the other of 
Bahrayn, and that it only later reached Syria, Egypt and Asia Minor. 
There is hardly any doubt that the use of hashish, at least in Egypt, 
started after the sixth century of the Hegira; for Abd al-Latif, who 
wrote in 605, does not mention it; and on the other hand, it must have 
been introduced there soon after this period, since Ibn Baytar, who died 
in 646, already found it commonly used among the fakirs in that 
country. 
I am not far from believing, however, that Sheikh Haydar did not 
have the honour of making the discovery attributed to him. The name 
qunnab Hindi (Indian hemp) given, according to Ibn Baytar, to the kind 
of hemp used under the name of hashish in Egypt, makes me think that 
this electuary originally came from India, that Haydar may have known 
it through some Indian yogi, and that it was perhaps from the same 
source that the Isma'ilis had come to know it before him. This is all the 
more plausible because in the doctrine of the Isma'ilis, we can 
recognize certain characteristics resembling Indian doctrines, such as 
the transmigration of souls, the incarnations of the divinity or avatars, 
emanations, etc. The conjecture I advance here is supported by Maqrizi 
himself, who says (Chrestomathie Arabe, Vol 1, p 120; Vol 2, p 126): 
However, I have it from Sheikh Muhammad Shirazi Qalandari 
that Sheikh Haydar never used any hashisha, and that the people 
of Khurasan only attribute the origin of this drug to him because 
his disciples are known to make regular use of it. From what he 
told me, hashisha goes back to a considerably earlier period than 
that of Sheikh Haydar. A sheikh called Biraztan, who lived in 
India, taught the people of this country to eat hashisha; they did 
not know it before. The use of this drug became so widespread in 
India that it was even introduced in Yaman; from there it spread 
to the province of Fars, and finally the inhabitants of Iraq, of Asia 
Minor, of Egypt and of Syria heard it mentioned for the first time 
in the year I indicated above. Biraztan lived at the time of the 
Khosroeses; he lived up to the Islamic period and became a 
Muslim. 
Whatever position we may take with regard to this question, it is 
obvious that hashisha could have been used by the Isma'ilis long before 
the sixth century of the Hegira, and that such an assumption does not 
contradict the historical facts that attribute its introduction among the 
fakirs to Sheikh Haydar, and its propagation to the disciples of this 
sheikh. 

I must now discuss various other names by which the Assassins are 
sometimes designated by the oriental writers. 
Neither Ibn Khaldun, in his historical Prolegomena, nor Shahrastani 
ever mentioned the Hashishis. The former says that the Ismaeilis were 
also called Batinis, Mazdakis and Qannatis in Iraq, and that in 
Khurasan they were called Ta'limis and Mulhids, but as far as they 
were concerned, they called themselves Isma'ilis. We shall explain each 
one of these names. 
The name Batini, that is, partisan of the inner meaning, is given to 
the Ismaeilis, as I have mentioned elsewhere, because they teach that 
everything external, such as the practices of worship, the precepts of the 
law, the profession of faith, etc., has an inner meaning, batin; that all 
revelation, tanzil, has an allegorical signification, ta'wil. This is what 
Shahrastani also says; and Ibn Khaldun is wrong in maintaining that 
they are called Batini because they recognize an internal imam, batin, 
meaning, as he adds, hidden, mastur. In the texts I have seen, the 
hidden imam is never called batin, but mastur or maktum. Every page 
of the books of the D w e s  provides evidence in favour of the first 
explanation. 
Mazdaki means member of the sect of Mazdak. This is an abusive 
term applied to the Isma'ilis because of the true or supposed 
conformity of their doctrine and their licentious behaviour with the 
morals and practices of Mazdak, an innovator who had caused great 
troubles in Persia under the reign of Qubad, and who was put to death 
under Khosroeushirvan.'The reader may refer, on this subject, to 
Mirkhwand's history of the Sasanid dynasty, which I published in my 
Mhoires sur diverses antiquitbs de la Perse. 
That the Isma'ilis were called Qamatis is a subject I need not dwell 
upon, since I already mentioned several times that the Qarmatis were 
the same as the Isma'ilis. The name Qannati was applied to them 
because one of their chiefs was thus nicknamed, the reason being, 
apparently, that he had short legs and could only take small steps. 
Malahida or mulhidun is the plural of mulhid, which means impious. 
According to Mirkhwand, this name was only given to the Isma'ilis of 
Persia after the fourth prince of their dynasty, Hasan son ofuhammad:' 
had publicly abjured the dogmas and practices of the 
Muslim religion; but the name continued to be applied to them since 
that time, and was even extended to the princes who had preceded the 
apostasy, although they were practising Muslims. 
And finally, again according to Shahrastani, the IsmaTlis were also 
called Taelimi in Khurasan. To explain this denomination, it must be 
pointed out that among the Muslim sects who agreed on the dogmas 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
(usul), and only disagreed regarding the moral laws and practices 
(furu), there were three different schools. The first, called ah1 al-ta'lim, 
the partisans of teaching, is based on these four authorities, the Koran, 
the Sunna, the consent of the imams on a point of doctrine (ijma), and 
reasonings based on induction (qiyas). The second only recognizes 
positive written authorities; it is therefore called ah1 al-nusus. The third 
mainly follows reason or probabilities: as a result, it is called ah1 al- 
ra'y. Hasan bin Sabbah professed to follow the first school. As this 
system is called ta'lim, Hasan and the members of his sea were called 
Taclimi. When explaining the four foundations of Hasan's doctrine, 
Shahrastani very positively maintains that the first one established the 
necessity of teaching (ta'lim) and was destined to refute those who 
accepted no other authority to decide about theological questions than 
reason and judgement (al-ra'ya ' l - a q l ) .The second foundation was 
meant to refute those who admitted no other authority but the 
Traditions, al-hadith (Notices et Extraits des Manuscrits, Vol IV, 
p 687; Maracci, Prodr. ad ref. Alcor., Pan 3, p 84). 
The Assassins have sometimes been confused with the Druzes and the 
Nusayris. Mr Venture, in a Memoir about the Druzes,s3 says that to all 
appearances, the Old Man of the Mountain was none other than the 
chief of the Druze nation. On the other hand, de Volney is convinced 
that the Assassins mentioned by William of Tyre were the Ansariyya. 
De Volney ought to have followed all the Arab authors, as well as 
Venture, and called these sectarians Nusayri or Nusayriyya in the 
plural. Falconet also confused the Nusayris with the Assassins, and 
reproached Assemani for having substituted the name Nazaris for the 
Nusayris or Nosroye of the Syrian historians. 
There is no doubt that the Nusayris are a branch of the Isma'ilis 
which is very close to the Qarmatis, even if it differs from the latter sea 
as regards its origin.s4 As for the Druzes, although their origin goes 
back to the Isma'ili sea itself, they differ from the Nusayris and other 
Isma'ili sects in several important dogmas, above all in believing in the 
divinity of the Fatimid caliph Hakim, in awaiting his return, and in 
obeying the commands of Hamza, his first minister.ss They anathema- 
tize the other Isma'ili sects, and in their sacred books there is an 
express refutation of the Nusayri system. What is more, the Nusayris, 
and even the Druzes, preceded the Hashishis; for I believe that this 
name was never applied to the Isma'ilis of the second period, or, to use 
Shahrastani's term, the second mission, al-da'wa al-thaniya. Hasan bin 
Sabbah, who initiated this second mission, did not appear until about 
the year 483. It is through him that the Isma'ili power in the Jibal was 
established, a power that later extended to Syria, around the year 520; 

and it was not until the establishment of this power in Alamut that the 
Batinis began to threaten the lives of kings and grandees. So it is an 
anachronism to confuse the Isma'ilis or Batinis, called Assassins, with 
the Druzes andu s ar i s . 'But I shall proceed to discuss a few other 
names given to the Assassins. 
One of the reasons why Venture thought that the Druzes were the 
Assassins mentioned by the historians of the Crusades, and that the 
chief or emir of the Druzes was the Old Man of the Mountain was, as 
he says, 
that the emir of the Druzes always had at his service a select troop 
called the Fidawiyya, that is, people ready to sacrifice themselves 
for his sake. Previously they were all Druzes by religion; now they 
are almost all Christians. There are no dangers or perils to which 
this troop does not expose itself when it is a matter of carrying out 
the prince's orders, and a recent example can be mentioned to 
show the blind devotion they profess. 
About 17 or 18 years ago, the emir Mulhim . . . violently 
quarrelled with a customs officer of Sidon, sent to him by the 
pasha of the province to expedite the payment of the tribute. The 
emir Mulhim swore to him in his wrath that he would have him 
killed whenever he could do so without violating the right of the 
people and of hospitality. One day when this customs officer was 
sitting in an open kiosk used as a warehouse for the Sidon 
customs, one of these Fidawiyya presented himself, armed with his 
gun and a pair of pistols. He examined everything coldbloodedly, 
recognized the customs officer ambng these people, took aim and 
killed him. When he had made quite sure that he had not missed 
him, he tried to reach the city gate, where he had a horse waiting 
for him; but before he could reach it, he was beaten to death by 
the rabble. 
It must be admitted that these Fidawiyya or Fidawis are closely 
connected with the ministers of vengeance of the chief of the Isma'ilis 
or Old Man of the Mountain. The difference is, however, that they are 
unlikely to be motivated by religious fanaticism, because, according to 
Venture, those who render this service to the emir of the Druzes are for 
the most part Christians. 
It might be added, though this would appear at first glance to 
confirm the opinion I am arguing against, that the killers or assassins of 
the chief of the Isma'ilis are also quite often called Fidawi or, which 
comes to the same, Fida'i, by Arab and Persian authors. For the time 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
being, I shall only quote one passage where this word is applied to the 
Assassins; but it will be sufficient to prove what I contend. The passage 
is by Abu'l-Faraj. When the Mongol Hulagu decided to destroy the 
Isma'ili power in Persia, this sea had as their chief Rukn al-Din 
Khurshah, son of Ala al-Din. 'This prince', says Abu'l-Faraj (Hist. 
dyn., Arabic text, p 506; Latin translation, p 330), 
first tried several ways to deceive Hulagu by feigning submission; 
but the Tartar let him know that the only course he could follow 
was to leave the fortress of Alamut where he was residing, and to 
go personally to the Mongol camp, or, if he did not want to do so, 
to prepare himself to sustain a siege. Rukn al-Din sent an 
accomplice to tell Hulagu that he dare not leave the place for fear 
that those who were confined there with him should try to kill 
him; but that, as soon as he would find an opportunity, he would 
come out. Convinced that Rukn al-Din was merely playing for 
time, Hulagu laid siege to the fortress; when Rukn al-Din saw 
this, he sent this message to Hulagu: I only delayed until now 
because I was not sure of your arrival; today or tomorrow, I shall 
come ro you. When he tried to go out, the most fanatic of the 
Mulhids rose against him, and the Fida'is rushed at him and 
prevented him from leaving. He advised Hulagu about their 
rebellion, and this prince sent word that he should treat them 
gently and cajole them for the time being, in order to protect his 
life from their attempts, but that he should somehow or other 
devise a way to come out, even if he had to disguise himself. At 
the same time, Hulagu ordered his emirs to surround the place 
from all sides, to set up machines against it, and to fight, each one 
on his part, those of the Isma'ilis who were to attack them. While 
the Mulhids were occupied in this engagement, Rukn al-Din went 
out with his son and the members of his court and surrendered to 
Hulagu. 
The Syriac Chronicle of Abu'l-Faraj (Greg. Bar-Hebraeus [Ibn 
al-'Ibri], Chron. Syr., Syriac text, p 520, Latin translation, p 540) 
reads: 'When Rukn al-Din wanted to go out, his men pointed their 
daggers at him, saying: If you go out, we will kill you.' 
It is certain that in this passage of Abu'l-Faraj, the Fida'is are not 
Isma'ilis or Mulhids in general, but a particular class of men, the most 
fanatic, the devoted, in short most probably those whom the Isma'ilis 
employed to kill their enemies;" it does not follow, all the same, that 

wherever there were Fida'is, these were Isma'ilis. Each sea, each 
prince, could have his own Fida'is. 
For instance in India, according to friar Vincent-Marie of Saint 
Catherine of Sienna, every prince, and even every Christian church, 
have their Amoks, who vow to risk their lives in order to protect the 
rights, privileges and properties of their patrons against everyone, even 
against another sovereign (Viaggi all'lnd. Orient., pp 145, 237). 
Muradjea d'Ohsson hence did not express himself accurately when 
saying that the sectarians of Hasan bin Sabbah, called Humayri after 
his name, were also called Fida'is because of the fervour with which 
they exposed their lives by marching under his banners (Tabl. g&. de 
l'empire Othoman, Vol 1, p 37). 
We can, therefore, assert that all the Isma'ilis were not Fida'is, 
although the professional assassins devoted to the sect were known by 
this name. Further proofs of this fact will be provided below, when I 
shall deal with this name as applied to the Isma'ilis. 
The confusion of the Assassins with the Nusayris, whom Assemani 
calls Nazarei, would no doubt have been generally admitted, albeit 
with no good reason, if it had been known that the Isma'ilis of Persia 
and Syria were also called Nizaris. I shall prove this fact, and at the 
same time explain the origin and meaning of this denomination. 
In the year 524 of the Hegira, the Fatimid caliph Arnir bi-Ahkam 
Allah was killed by the Batinis, as is reported by Abu'l-Faraj, Abu'l- 
Fida, Renaudot, etc. (Hist. dyn., Arabic text, p 380; Latin translation, p 
250; Annales Moslernici, Vol 3, p 439; Hist. patr. Alex. p 496); 
however, Maqrizi attributes this assassination to the Nizaris, and 
Mirkhwand to the Batinis and the Nizaris. But this apparent contradic- 
tion can easily be explained. For the Nizaris are none other than a 
faction of the Batinis founded on the death of the Fatimid caliph 
Mustansir billah. This caliph had as his successor his son Abu'l-Qasim 
Ahmad Musta'li billah; but as I indicated at the beginning of this 
Memoir, Musta'li did not succeed his father by general consent, since 
his brother Nizar had been a contestant for the throne. 'On this 
occasion', says Maqrizi (Arabic Manuscript of the Bibliothique du Roi, 
no 682, fol 199v), 'the Isma'ilis split into two parties, the Nizaris who 
considered Musta'li as an illegitimate caliph, and another party, who 
acknowledged him as the legitimate caliph.' Renaudot mentioned 
Nizar's revolt against Musta'li; but he did not mention the schism that 
this caused among the Isma'ilis (Hist. patr. Alex., p 475), a schism 
continuing under several reigns. Here I cannot dispense with quoting an 
excerpt from Mirkhwand, which will perfectly clarify these facts. This 
is what he reports while briefly outlining the history of the Fatimid 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
caliphs of Egypt (Arabic Manuscript of the Bibliothique de L'Arsenal, 
no 20): 
Mustansir had first named his eldest son, Mustafa li-Din Allah 
Nizar, as his successor, but later, being dissatisfied with him, he 
ordered in his testament that Nizar was to renounce all pretension 
to becoming the sovereign, and that the crown should be 
conferred on his other son Musta'li billah. When Mustansir died, 
the Isma'ilis split into two parties: some swore allegiance to 
Musta'li and made him accede to the throne; others, following 
the dogmas of their sea, believed that the earlier provision ought 
to be maintained, and embraced Nizar's party. Hasan bin Sabbah 
Humayri adopted the second party. Indeed, the Nizari of Kuhistan 
was one of the partisans of Mustafa li-Din Allah, and his very 
name, Nizari, proves this assertion. These people argue, in 
support of their opinion, that the imam Ja'far Sadiq had first 
chosen his son Isma'il as his successor to the imamate; and that 
later, having found out that Isma'il indulged in drinking wine, he 
disowned him and ordered that after his death the imamate 
should be transmitted to Musa Kazim. But as the Isma'ilis think 
that the first designation should retain all its force, they consider 
Isma'il, rather than Musa, as the successor of Ja'far Sadiq to the 
dignity of imam. Once Musta'li saw himself in possession of the 
caliphate, he decided to rid himself of his brother Nizar; but to 
protea his life, Nizar retired to Alexandria and stayed with a 
servant of his father's who was governor there. The latter declared 
Musta'li as deposed from the caliphate, and proclaimed Nizar as 
caliph. Musta'li, however, had a great army march against 
Alexandria. The governor of the city, who had embraced Nizar's 
party, was captured and put to death. Nizar was arrested with his 
two sons and sent to Musta'li, who imprisoned him in Cairo; he 
remained a prisoner there until his death. Musta'li had been 
reigning for seven years when he was stabbed to death, it is said, 
at the age of 28, by some of Nizar's partisans. 
His son Amir bi-Ahkam Allah succeeded him . . . While he was 
reigning, he was killed by some Nizaris, enemies of the amir al- 
juyush (or generalissimo of the armies) who was Amir's father-in- 
law . . . Aqsunqur, one of the principal lords of the caliph's court, 
was also stabbed to death in the jami of Mosul, by some of the 
Fida'is among the Nizaris. Under Amir's reign, the Nizari faction 
started to appear in Syria, and some fortified places of this 
province fell into their hands. On the 4th of Dhu'l-Qa'da 524, a 

troop of Batinis and fanatics of the Nizari faction assassinated 
Amir as a reprisal for the death of Nizar. Hafiz li-Din Allah, who 
succeeded him, had conferred the office of vizier to Abu Ali 
Ahmad, son of Afdal amir al-juyush, who, having been promoted 
to this dignity, was killed by some Fida'is among the Nizaris 
within the first days of his administration. A few days later, they 
also killed the person who had been appointed to replace him, 
again to avenge the same 
This explains in what way and for what reason Hasan bin Sabbah, 
who had merely established himself in Kuhistans9 as a ddi of the 
Fatimid caliphs, and who acknowledged their sovereignty, having 
allegedly received the patents of investiture from Mustansir, went so far 
as not only to make himself independent in this province, but also to 
take possession of some places in Syria that belonged to the Fatimids. 
For since the schism that had occurred among the Isma'ilis after 
Mustansir's death, Hasan had embraced Nizar's party and considered 
Musta'li and his successors as usurpers of the caliphate. 
So at his death, he ordered that Kiya Buzurg-Ummid and the Dihdar 
Abu Ali should administer, one of them the affairs of the sea, the other 
those of the divan, in agreement with the generalissimo Hasan Qasrani, 
until such time as the imam himself came to assume the head of the 
government. Mirkhwand informs us that since one of the princes of the 
Ismacili dynasty of Persia, Hasan son of Muhammad, son of Buzurg- 
Ummid, had exempted his subjects from all legal observances, he was 
the cause, through this conduct, of their being attributed the name of 
Mulhids, which was extended to include even his predecessors, even 
though this latter had observed the laws of Islam. Although this prince 
was publicly acknowledged to be the son of Muhammad bin Buzurg- 
Ummid, he nevertheless sometimes ambiguously, sometimes openly 
declared, in a great number of writings he sent to various places, that 
he was a descendant of Nizar, son of the caliph Mustansir, and that he 
was the true caliph and the imam.60 'The Nizaris', adds Mirkhwand, 
have invented all sorts of legends and ridiculous tales to justify 
this pretension of Hasan's. Even during his father's lifetime, he 
wanted to pass himself off as the imam promised by Hasan bin 
Sabbah; but Muhammad had stopped this folly by publicly 
declaring that Hasan was his son, that for him he was not the 
imam, but only one of the da'is of the imam, and by putting to 
death a great number of those who had accepted Hasan's 
eccentricities. 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
Here we must observe, as we already announced above, that 
Mirkhwand always uses the word Fida'i when referring to the men the 
Isma'ilis employed to assassinate their enemies. Thus he says that the 
illustrious Nizam al-Mulk, the vizier of Malikshah, was assassinated by 
a Fida'i by order of Hasan bin Sabbah; that under the reign of Hasan 
bin Sabbah, many Muslim princes who had quarrels with the IsmaTlis 
were assassinated by Fida'is; that under the reign of his successor, Kiya 
Buzurg-Ummid, the Fida'is killed a considerable number of Muslim 
princes or great dignitaries, such as the great Qadi Abu Sa'id of Herat; 
a son of Musta'li, the caliph of Egypt, who was assassinated by seven 
of the Rafiqs; Dawlatshah, ra'is of Ispahan; Aqsunqur, the governor of 
Maragha; Mustansir,6' the caliph of Baghdad; the ra'is of Tabriz, 
Hasan son of Abu'l-Qasim, the mufti of Qazwin, etc.; he repeats the 
same thing at the end of the reign of Muhammad, son of Kiya Buzurg- 
Ummid, etc. The word Fidawi is also used in his narrative of the 
undertakings of sultan Malik al-Nasir Muhammad, son of Qala'un, 
against Qarasunqur, of which I provided an excerpt above. This 
observation confirms what I said about the meaning of the word fida'i, 
and at the same time provides me with the opportunity to explain 
another expression which I often encountered in Mirkhwand; I mean 
the word rafiq, plural rafiqan. 
Rafiq in Arabic literally means companion, assistant, fellow-traveller; 
but several passages in Mirkhwand that I quoted in this Memoir, and a 
great number of others that I could mention, prove that this word had a 
special and, as it were, technical connotation among the Isma'ilis. 
Hasan bin Ali bin Sabbah says the following about himself: 
I had always, like my fathers, professed the doctrine of the 
Shi'ites, who accept the succession of the twelve imams. It 
happened by chance that I met a man among the Rafiqs, whose 
name was Amira Darrab, and a close relationship developed 
between us . . . Each time Amira spoke in support of the Isma'ili. 
doctrine, I would have an argument with him on this subject . . . 
Later, I came into contact with another Isma'ili, called Abu Najm 
Sarraj, and I asked him to instruct me fully in the doctrine of the 
Isma'ilis . . . Finally I met a da'i of this religion, called Mu'min, 
who had received from Sheikh Abd al-Malik bin Atrush, da'i of 
the province of Iraq, the permission to exercise the ministry of 
da'i.62 
This passage proves that Rafiq and Isma'ili are two synonymous 
words, or at least that those who were known by the name of Rafiq 

were Ismaeilis. It also proves that this denomination preceded Hasan 
bin Sabbah; but it gives rise to the suspicion that there was a difference 
between the ddis and the Rafiqs. The following passage confirms this 
opinion: 
Hasan [to quote Mirkhwand again,] having consolidated himself 
in the possession of Alamut and neighbouring places, left nothing 
to chance in his efforts to make himself master, either by force or 
by mildness, of the entire government of Rudbar; after which he 
sent the ddi Husayn Qa'ini with a troop of R&s 
to preach his 
doctrine to the peoples of Kuhistan. Malikshah had one of his 
generals, Qizil Sariq, march into Kuhistan to oppose the progress 
of Husayn Qa'ini. As a result, Qizil Sariq made his utmost efforts 
to drive off the Mulhids from Kuhistan. Husayn Qa'ini withdrew 
with his Rafiqs into a fortress in the territory of Muminabad. 
While Qizil Sariq was laying siege to it, news of Malikshah's 
death arrived, forcing him to raise the siege. 
When relating the siege of Alamut by the troops of Malikshah, the 
same historian says that Hasan had no more than 70 R&s 
with him. 
Speaking about the princes and illustrious personalities who were 
assassinated bnder the reign and by order of Kiya Buzurg-Ummid, he 
says: 'During the government of Buzurg-Ummid, the Fidu'is killed 
several princes and illustrious personalities. Among those who were 
killed were the qadi of the East and West, Abu Saeid of Herat; a son of 
Mustali, who was assassinated in Egypt by seven of the Rafiqs, etc.' 
And finally, when reporting the events that took place under the 
reign of Kiya Buzurg-Ummid, Mirkhwand uses the word Rafiq a great 
many times. I shall quote an excerpt from the report, retaining this 
word each time it occurs. 
When Sultan Mahmud the Saljuqid wanted to make peace with 
Kiya Buzurg-Ummid, one of his officers was put in charge of 
making the initial overtures to the Isma'ili prince, who sent a 
deputy to Ispahan to negotiate the affair. This deputy, called 
Khwaja Muhammad Nasihi Shahrastani, was leaving the audience 
of sultan Mahmud when he was killed together with a Rafiq by 
the rabble, in a bazaar. The sultan immediately sent someone to 
apologize to Buzurg-Ummid, and to protest that he had had no 
hand in this assassination. Buzurg-Ummid sent word to the sultan 
that he must punish the murderers, otherwise he was to expect the 
vengeance he would not fail to wreak on this act of perfidy. As 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
Mahmud paid no attention to the demands of Buzurg-Ummid, the 
Rafiqs came to the gate of Qazwin at the beginning of the year 
523, killed four people and took away many animals. The 
inhabitants of Qazwin started to pursue them; but one of the 
principals of the city was killed, and they saw themselves obliged 
to flee. When in the year 525, 1000 men of the troops of Iraq 
approached the fortress of Lankir, the Rafiqs, having been 
informed of their advance, put them to flight without there being 
any bloodshed. Sultan Mahmud having died about that time, the 
Rafiqs again raided the territory of Qazwin, took away some 
animals, and killed a 100 Turkomans and 20 inhabitants of 
Qazwin. 
In the year 526, the army of Alamut advanced into Gilan to 
make war against Abu Hashim Alawi, because the latter had 
assumed the title of imam, and was sending letters everywhere to 
have himself acknowledged as such. Kiya Buzurg-Ummid had first 
written him a letter full of advice and representations, to make 
him retract, or to have a proof of his crime. Abu Hashim's only 
reply was that the Isma'ili sect professed a doctrine containing 
incredulity, heresy and Zindaqa (or Magism). So the Rafiqs 
entered Daylam and fought against Abu Hashim, who was put to 
flight and hid in a forest. But the Rafiqs pursued him and gained 
control over him; and having sharply reprimanded him, they 
burnt him. 
It can be seen, from these excerpts, that Mirkhwand distinguishes the 
Rafiqs or Rafiqis from the Da'is as well as from the Fida'is. I think 
that the Rafiqs are all members of the sect, with the exception of the 
Da'is, who formed the clergy, and Fida'is, who were specifically 
destined to act as assassins.63 
I do not know whether this distinction also applies to the name 
Hashishis. I have not come across a sufficient number of passages 
containing this word to have a definite opinion in this respect; but I 
tend to believe that, among the Ismaeilis, the names Husbishi or 
Hashshash were applied only to people specially trained to function as 
assassins and induced, through the use of hashish, to display this 
absolute resignation to the wishes of their chief. This would not have 
prevented other peoples, and above all Westerners, from extending this 
denomination to include all the Isma'ilis. 
The IsmaTli sea was probably known by other names as well; for 
Shahrastani says that it has a different denomination in each nation. 
Abraham Ecchellensis says that they are called Ta'tili, which is 

plausible, because this name refers to a partisan of the dogma of tdtil, 
which consists of divesting God of all attributes, a dogma amounting to 
pure deism and almost approaching atheism. According to Muradjea, 
they are also called Humayri after their chief Hasan bin Sabbah who 
was surnamed Humayri (Tabl. gin. de f'empire Othoman, Vol 1, 
p 36). However, I have found no trace of this denomination. 
I shall end this Memoir by pointing out a passage in the Voyage of 
Niebuhr, (Voyage en Arabie, Vol2, p 361), who informs us that there 
still exist Isma'ilis in Syria, and by quoting an excerpt of a letter 
Rousseau's son wrote to me from Teheran, dated 1 June 1808. 
I have collected some fairly exact notions about the Batinis or 
Isma'ilis commonly called Mklahkd2hs, a sea which still survives 
and is widespread and tolerated, like many others, in the 
provinces of Persia and in the Sind. As I have very little free time, 
please excuse my putting off the task of going into a detailed 
discussion until some other time. Meanwhile, it may be useful to 
tell you that the Mdlahkd2hs even today have their imam or 
pontiff, descending, as they claim, from Ja'far Sadiq, the chief of 
their sea, and residing at Kehek, a village in the district of Qom. 
He is called Sheikh Khalil Allah and succeeded in the imamate to 
his uncle, Mirza Abu'l-Hasan, who played a great part under the 
reign of the Zends. The Persian government does not worry him, 
for he receives annual revenues from it. This person, whom his 
people grace with the pompous title of caliph, enjoys a great 
reputation and is considered to have the gift of performing 
miracles. They assure me that the Muslim Indians regularly come 
from the banks of the Indus to receive his blessings in exchange 
for the rich and pious offerings they bring him. He is more 
specifically known to the Persians by the name of Seid Keheki.64

written without any critical sense. The author has the Assassins descend from 
the Kurds and ill-advisedly confuses them with the Shamsis or worshippers of

Hasan arrived in Egypt in 47111078 and stayed there for three years. The 
reasons for Badr's hostility towards Hasan remain obscure, but it is almost 
certain that they did not relate to the issue of al-Mustansir's succession. (F.D.)

al-Mustansir's succession belongs to a later period. It occurred on the death of

Badr's son and successor al-Afdal, the new effective ruler of the Fatimid state.

he annexed to the Life of Saladin by Baha al-Din, reads Masyat; Koehler, on 
the other hand (Tab. Syr., p 20, n 82), maintains that it should be read Masyaf. 
Reiske (Annul. Mosl., Vol3, p 485) cannot decide between the two, but prefers 
the second. Renaudot (Hist. patr. Alex., p 541) writes Mosiab. This place 
name can be found neither in the Qamus, nor in the Dictionary of 
geographical homonyms by Yaqut; but in the Marasid al-ittila it is spelt 
Masyath. 
I am convinced that the true name of this place is Masyat. In the apocryphal 
Latin letter reported in the Chronicle of Nicolas de Trcveth, it is written 
Messiat. Here is the passage: Leopoldo, duci Ausmae, vetus de monte, salutem

Constantin Lempereur and Baratier thought that Molhat, in Benjamin's

translated in regionem Molhath, ubi populi degunt qui, etc.; the second said au 
pays de Molhat, ou sont &s peupks (Voy. & Rabbi Benjamin, Vol 1, p 176): 
this is a mistake. Benjamin was well aware that Molhat was not the name of a 
country, but that of a people; for he said: 'From there it is a four-day's walk to 
the temtory of the Molhats: they are the people who', etc. ( M h .  & I'Acad.

It may seem uncertain whether the words he could not refer to the assassin or 
to the emir. According to Ibn Abi'l-Tayyi's account, it appears certain that the 
assassin is meant. 
In the first account, it was Saladin who pulled the assassin's head toward 
himself, threw him on the ground and straddled him; here it is the assassin 
who seizes the sultan's head. Perhaps the passage should read wa jadhaba 
ra'sahu al-sultan, but the sultan pulled his head toward himself. 
I have found in the Turkish tales of the Forty Viziers (Les Quarante Vizirs) the 
Turkish word ut, herb, used in the same sense as the Arabic word hashish. A 
woman who wanted to enjoy herself with an admirer under the very eyes of 
her husband, organized an outing with the latter in a wood where she had 
made a tryst with her lover, who was hiding there. When husband and wife 
had sat down under a tree, she took a small dose of a cordial, mufanah, and 
made her husband take a large dose of it. Having eaten and rested afterwards, 
they were intoxicated with the effect of this drug. The wife climbed a tree, and 
pretending that she saw her husband with another woman under the tree, she 
chided him for it. The husband protested that it was not true. The wife then 
said: Is it the effect of the herb we have eaten, or is there some extraordinary 
quality in this tree? I leave out the rest of this indecent and incidentally quite 
well-known story. See Forty Viziers, 31st morning.

Literature and Fine Arts, Vol V, p 457, quotes the opinion of Lamark, who 
calls this variety of hemp cannabis Indica, and differentiates it from that which 
is grown in Europe. This is also the opinion of Ibn Baytar, who considers 
Egyptian hemp as a particular variety which he calls qunnab Hindi, Indian 
hemp. 
41. This is the literal meaning of the words ya'nafin min intisabihum laha, which 
I failed to render with the necessary precision in my Chrestomathie. 
42. 1 nevertheless have no doubt that the hemp leaf mixed with some other drugs 
can produce a violent mania, a fury resembling that of the Amoks, who threw 
themselves fearlessly amidst swords and lances. And it is in fact opium, a 
substance whose effects are similar to those of hashish, which produces this 
furious delirium in the Amoks; but to do this, it has to be mixed with lemon 
juice several days in advance. Some people think that other ingredients are 
added to it (Voyage au Bengale, by Cossigny, Vol 3, pp 103 and 163). The 
following references can be looked up regarding the Amoks: Kaempfer, 
Amoenit. exot., p 649; Anquetil-Duperron, Zend-Av., Vol 1, p clviii; de 
Grandprk, Voyage &m l'lnde et au Beng., Vol 1, p 71; Father Vincent Marie 
of Saint Catherine of Sienna, Viaggi all'lnd. Orient., pp 145, 150, 237 and 
238; Legoux de Flaix, Tabkau de l'lndoustan, Vol2, p 394; Percival, Voyage 
a Cqrlan, Vol 1, p 222. According to the latter, it was not with opium as such 
that the bylanese went amok, but with the sap or leaves of bang, a small 
shrub whose leaf resembles the tobacco leaf in its texture and shape, but is not 
longer than the sage leaf. The same author says that these furious men, when 
running after their victim, shout amok, amok, meaning, kill, kill; Legoux de 
Flaix maintains that the Malayans call this state of drunkenness amok in their 
language; Anquetil says that the word amoque comes from the Portuguese, and 
that the Amoks are called Narangols by the Malabars. But 1 think that 
Narangol is the name of a tribe which is surnamed Amok because these people 
are professional assassins. I find in the Maiay Dictionary of Howison the word 
amuq translated as desperado, murderer, one who kills all he can; the verb 
amaq means to kill, to massacre. (See the Dictionmire Malai of W. Marsden.) 
In the excerpt of the voyage of a young Englishman to Batavia and China, 
published in the European Magazine and included in the Journal de 1ittLrature 
itrangire (March 1807, p 135), we also read that the Amoks work themselves 
into a state of freny by taking strong doses of opium, and that the murders 
they then commit are called mocks because, in these expeditions, they cry 
amok, amok, meaning kill, kill. Be that as it may, there is no fact, to my mind, 
that justifies a comparison between the Assassins and the Amoks. 
43. I have already corrected Marco Polo's mistake regarding the word mukhet. 
This author was the cause of Baratier's and Falconet's mistakes. 
44. The Albigensians. 
45. Ala al-Din was the penultimate emir of the Isma'ilis of Persia. The gardens 
Marco Polo mentions here were made by Hasan bin Sabbah. 

Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins 
46. In the book entitled Les Quarante Vizirs, there is a romance which seems 
modelled on the story I related here after Marco Polo. It occurs on the 
nineteenth morning of this book of episodes. The nineteenth vizier wants to 
prove to the king that women are capable of all sorts of stratagems,and ruses 
to satisfy their passions, so he tells him the story of a princess who had fallen 
madly in love with one of the pages of her father, the king. Having for a long 
time concealed her passion, she confides it to the woman who serves her. The 
latter soon finds a way to satisfy her. Disguised as a man, she enters the room 
where the young page spends the night, and having made him drink a soporific 
beverage, she transports him, without his being aware of it, into the apartment 
of the princess, and puts him, fast asleep, on some rich cushions. The princess 
then approaches him and gently wakes him up by pouring a few drops of 
strong vinegar on his forehead. He gradually wakes up and, seeing himself 
surrounded by the most seductive luxury and beauty, says: Surely I must be 
dead and they have transported me to paradise. Needless to add that the same 
method that had been employed to bring him, without his knowledge, into the 
apartment of the princess was used again to take him back to his own room. 
47. Boccaccio seems to have followed a slightly different tradition when attributing 
the effect in question to a certain powder used by the Old Man of the 
Mountain to put to sleep those whom he wanted to take into his paradise or 
out of it (3rd journ., 8th tale). This diversity of traditions confirms rather than 
weakens my conjecture, since hashish was taken equally as a powder, an 
elcctuary and a beverage. 
48. 1 am not quoting the chapter-of Pepin's Chronicle, which includes (Book 111, 
Ch XXXIX) details quite similar to those given by Marco Polo (see Script. rer. 
Itul. by Muratori, Vol IX, col705 ff.) This monk, who translated Marco Polo's 
Travels into Latin, must have borrowed from him what he says about the 
Assassins. 
49. I first thought that there was a mistake in the manuscript, and that it should 
read sahib al-Hashishiyya, master of the Hashishis, but I believe that this 
correction would have truly altered the text, the more so since sahib more 
usually has as its complement the name of a country or a thing, rather than the 
name of a man or of a nation. 
50. See the History of the Saranids, translated from Mirkhwand's Persian in the 
Mhoires sur diverses antiquittfs de la Perse, pp 273 ff. [Now, see the helpful 
survey by E. Yarshater, 'Mazdakism', in The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol3 
(11), ed. E. Yarshater (Cambridge, 1983), pp 991-1024; and P. Crone, 
'Kavad's Heresy and Mazdak's Revolt', Iran, Journal of the British Institute of 
Persian Studies, 29 (1991), pp 21-42. (F.D.)] 
51. See the Note on the universal history of Mirkhwand, in Vol IX of the Notices 
et Extraits &s Manuscrits, pp 117 ff. [Hasan is regarded by the Nizaris as a 
descendant of Nizar b. al-Mustansir, and not as Muhammad's son. It was with 
this Hasan that the line of the Nizari Isma'ili imams re-emerged openly during 
the Alamut period. (F.D.)]

56. Mr de Volney committed even a greater anachronism in saying that the caliph 
Ali was killed by a Batini or Assassin. Voyage en Syrie et en Zgypte, Vol 1, p

57. fit. Quatremire, in his Mtmoires giographiques et historiques sur l'igypte, Vol 
2, p 504, also attributes the denomination of Fidawis among the Isma'ilis 
exclusively to professional assassins. 
58. Mirkhwand's account, quoted hue, is full of errors and inaccuracies. (F.D.) 
59. De Sacy often confuses Persia with Kuhistan (Arabic, Quhistan), one of the 
main Persian Isma'ili territories in southern Khurasan. (F.D.) 
60. The ancestry of this Hasan, called ala dhiktih21-salam by the Nizaris, and his 
successors at Alamut was traced to Nizar, and their Nizarid Fatimid genealogy 
and imamates were acknowledged by the contemporary Nizari Isma'ili 
community. (F.D.) 
61. The Abbasid caliph in question was al-Mustarshid (512-52911118-35). (F.D.) 
62. The da'i in question was Abd al-Malik ibn Attash who, at the time, headed the 
Ismaeili movement throughout the central and western regions of Persia, and 
possibly also in Khurasan and Iraq. (F.D.) 
63. It appears that the word laziq, attach&, follower, was also used in the same 
sense as r&. 
This seems to follow from two passages of Arab authors, quoted 
by 6t. Quatremtre in his Mknoires giographiques et historiques sur l'ggypte, 
Vol 2, pp 11 1 and 502. 
64. Shah Khalil Allah, the 45th imam of the Nizari IsmaClis, succeeded his father, 
Abul-Hasan Ali, also known as Sayyid Kahaki, in 120611792. Shah Khalil 
Allah spent the final years of his life at Yazd, and was murdered there in 123U 
1817. See Daftary, The Isma'ilis, pp 5034. (F.D.)
